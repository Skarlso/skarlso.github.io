      <description>Hi folks.
I attended a 4 day course of Groovy and Grails and this is my attempt at writing up a summary to see how much I retained. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to do this from the top of my head without peaking at my notes.
So let&amp;rsquo;s begin.
Introductions
First of all, introductions. The course was held by Peter Ledbrook. He is the guy who wrote Grails in Action. He is awesome, go check him out.</description>
