      <description>Intro Hi Folks.
This is a follow up on my previous post about Google Sign-In. In this post we will discover what to do with the information retrieved in the first encounter, which you can find here: Google Sign-In Part 1.
Forewords The Project Everything I did in the first post, and that I&amp;rsquo;m going to do in this example, can be found in this project: Google-OAuth-Go-Sample.
Just to recap, we left off previously on the point where we successfully obtained information about the user, with a secure token and a session initiated with them.</description>
