      <description>Intro Hello folks.
Today, I would like to tell you about my configuration for a low budget Home Theater setup.
My tools are as follows:
 FLIRC Raspberry Pi 2 500G SSD An a good &amp;lsquo;ol wifi  TL;DR Use Flirc for remote control, omxplayer for streaming the movie from an SSD on a headless PI controller via SSH and enjoy a nice, cold Lemon - Menta beer.
Flirc First, the remote control.</description>
