      <description>Hi folks.
Quick gotcha, when working with Drupal. If you just freshly installed it, and everything seems to work fine, and yet you are experiencing things like, the admin toolbar is randomly disappearing, or configuration is not saved; than you might not have modrewrite enabled on your apache server.
Because, by default, Drupal has clean url enabled, that needs URL rewriting on apache.
So, step one.
Have this in your .</description>
