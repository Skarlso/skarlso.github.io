<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what go-plugin is, don&rsquo;t worry, here is a small introduction on the subject matter:</p>

<p>Back in the old days when Go didn&rsquo;t have the <code>plugin</code> package, HashiCorp was desperately looking for a way to use plugins.</p>

<p>In the old days, Lua plus Go wasn&rsquo;t really a thing yet, and to be honest, nobody wants to write Lua ( joking!).</p>

<p>And thus Mitchell had this brilliant idea of using RPC over the local network to serve a local interface as something that could easily be implemented with any other language that supported RPC. This sounds convoluted but has many benefits! For example, your code will never crash because of a plugin and the ability to use any language to implement a plugin. Not just Go.</p>

<p>It has been a battle-hardened solution for years now and is being actively used by Terraform, Vault, Consule, and especially Packer. All using go-plugin in order to provide a much needed flexibility. Writing a plugin is easy. Or so they say.</p>

<p>It can get complicated quickly, for example, if you are trying to use GRPC. You can lose sight of what exactly you&rsquo;ll need to implement, where and why; or utilizing various languages or using go-plugins in your own project and extending your CLI with pluggable components.</p>

<p>These are all nothing to sneeze at. Suddenly you&rsquo;ll find yourself with hundreds of lines of code pasted from various examples and yet nothing works. Or worse, it DOES work but you have no idea how. Then you find yourself needing to extend it with a new capability, or you find an elusive bug and can&rsquo;t trace its origins.</p>

<p>Fear not. I&rsquo;ll try to demystify things and draw a clear picture about how it works and how the pieces fit together.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start at the beginning.</p>

<h1 id="basic-plugin">Basic plugin</h1>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start by writing a simple Go GRPC plugin. In fact, we can go through the basic example in the go-plugin’s repository which can be quite confusing when first starting out. We&rsquo;ll go step-by-step, and the switch to GRPC will be much easier!</p>

<h2 id="basic-concepts">Basic concepts</h2>

<h3 id="server">Server</h3>

<p>In the case of plugins, the Server is the one serving the plugin&rsquo;s implementation. This means the server will have to provide the implementation to an interface.</p>

<h3 id="client">Client</h3>

<p>The Client calls the server in order to execute the desired behaviour. The underlying logic will connect to the server running on localhost on a random higher port, call the wanted function’s implementation and wait for a response. Once the response is received provide that back to the calling Client.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<h3 id="the-main-function">The main function</h3>

<h4 id="logger">Logger</h4>

<p>The plugins defined here use stdout in a special way. If you aren&rsquo;t writing a Go based plugin, you will have to do that yourself by outputting something like this:</p>

<pre><code>1|1|tcp|127.0.0.1:1234|grpc
</code></pre>

<p>We&rsquo;ll come back to this later. Suffice to say the framework will pick this up and will connect to the plugin based on the output. In order to get some output back, we must define a special logger:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	// Create an hclog.Logger
	logger := hclog.New(&amp;hclog.LoggerOptions{
		Name:   &quot;plugin&quot;,
		Output: os.Stdout,
		Level:  hclog.Debug,
	})
</code></pre>

<h4 id="newclient">NewClient</h4>

<pre><code class="language-go">	// We're a host! Start by launching the plugin process.
	client := plugin.NewClient(&amp;plugin.ClientConfig{
		HandshakeConfig: handshakeConfig,
		Plugins:         pluginMap,
		Cmd:             exec.Command(&quot;./plugin/greeter&quot;),
		Logger:          logger,
	})
	defer client.Kill()
</code></pre>

<p>What is happening here? Let&rsquo;s see one by one:</p>

<p><code>HandshakeConfig: handshakeConfig,</code>: This part is the handshake configuration of the plugin. It has a nice comment as well.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// handshakeConfigs are used to just do a basic handshake between
// a plugin and host. If the handshake fails, a user friendly error is shown.
// This prevents users from executing bad plugins or executing a plugin
// directory. It is a UX feature, not a security feature.
var handshakeConfig = plugin.HandshakeConfig{
	ProtocolVersion:  1,
	MagicCookieKey:   &quot;BASIC_PLUGIN&quot;,
	MagicCookieValue: &quot;hello&quot;,
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>ProtocolVersion</code> here is used in order to maintain compatibility with your current plugin versions. It&rsquo;s basically like an API version. If you increase this, you will have two options. Don&rsquo;t accept lower protocol versions nor switch to the version number and use a different client implementation for a lower version than for a higher version. This way you will maintain backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>The <code>MagicCookieKey</code> and <code>MagicCookieValue</code> are used for a basic handshake which the comment is talking about. You have to set this <strong>ONCE</strong> for your application. Never change it again, for if you do, your plugins will no longer work. For uniqueness sake, I suggest using UUID.</p>

<p><code>Cmd</code> is one of the most important parts about a plugin. Basically how plugins work is that they boil down to a compiled binary which is executed and starts an RPC server. This is where you will have to define the binary which will be executed and does all this. Since this is all happening locally, (please keep in mind that Go-plugins only support localhost, and for a good reason), these binaries will most likely sit next to your application&rsquo;s binary or in a pre-configured global location. Something like:  <code>~/.config/my-app/plugins</code>. This is individual for each plugin of course. The plugins can be autoloaded via a discovery function given a path and a glob.</p>

<p>And last but not least is the <code>Plugins</code> map. This map is used in order to identify a plugin called <code>Dispense</code>. This map is globally available and must stay consistent in order for all the plugins to work:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// pluginMap is the map of plugins we can dispense.
var pluginMap = map[string]plugin.Pluglin	&quot;greeter&quot;: &amp;example.GreeterPlugin{},
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that the key is the name of the plugin and the value is the plugin.</p>

<p>We then proceed to create an RPC client:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	// Connect via RPC
	rpcClient, err := client.Client()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
</code></pre>

<p>Nothing fancy about this one&hellip;</p>

<p>Now comes the interesting part:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	// Request the plugin
	raw, err := rpcClient.Dispense(&quot;greeter&quot;)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
</code></pre>

<p>What&rsquo;s happening here? Dispense will look in the above created map and search for the plugin. If it cannot find it, it will throw an error at us. If it does find it, it will cast this plugin to an RPC or a GRPC type plugin. Then proceed to create an RPC or a GRPC client out of it.</p>

<p>There is no call yet. This is just creating a client and parsing it to a respective representation.</p>

<p>Now comes the magic:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	// We should have a Greeter now! This feels like a normal interface
	// implementation but is in fact over an RPC connection.
	greeter := raw.(example.Greeter)
	fmt.Println(greeter.Greet())
</code></pre>

<p>Here we are type asserting our raw GRPC client into our own plugin type. This is so we can call the respective function on the plugin! Once that&rsquo;s done we will have a {client,struct,implementation} that can be called like a simple function.</p>

<p>The implementation right now comes from greeter_impl.go, but that will change once protoc makes an appearance.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, go-plugin will do a bunch of hat tricks with multiplexing TCP connections as well as a remote procedure call to our plugin. Our plugin then will run the function, generate some kind of output, and will then send that back for the waiting client.</p>

<p>The client will then proceed to parse the message into a given response type and will then return it back to the client’s callee.</p>

<p>This concludes main.go for now.</p>

<h3 id="the-interface">The Interface</h3>

<p>Now let’s investigate the Interface. The interface is used to provide calling details. This interface will be what defines our plugins’ capabilities. How does our <code>Greeter</code> look like?</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Greeter is the interface that we're exposing as a plugin.
type Greeter interface {
	Greet() string
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is pretty simple. It defines a function which will return a string typed value.</p>

<p>Now, we will need a couple of things for this to work. Firstly we need something which defines the RPC workings. go-plugin is working with <code>net/http</code> inside. It also uses something called Yamux for connection multiplexing, but we needn’t worry about this detail.</p>

<p>Implementing the RPC details looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Here is an implementation that talks over RPC
type GreeterRPC struct {
    client *rpc.Client
}

func (g *GreeterRPC) Greet() string {
	var resp string
	err := g.client.Call(&quot;Plugin.Greet&quot;, new(interface{}), &amp;resp)
	if err != nil {
		// You usually want your interfaces to return errors. If they don't,
		// there isn't much other choice here.
		panic(err)
	}

	return resp
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here the GreeterRPC struct is an RPC specific implementation that will handle communication over RPC. This is Client in this setup.</p>

<p>In case of gRPC, this would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// GRPCClient is an implementation of KV that talks over RPC.
type GreeterGRPC struct{ client proto.GreeterClient }

func (m *GreeterGRPC) Greet() (string, error) {
    s, err := m.client.Greet(context.Background(), &amp;proto.Empty{})
	return s, err
}
</code></pre>

<p>What is happening here? What&rsquo;s Proto and what is GreeterClient? GRPC uses Google&rsquo;s protoc library to serialize and unserialize data. <code>proto.GreeterClient</code> is generated Go code by protoc. This code is a skeleton for which implementation detail will be replaced on run time. Well, the actual result will be used and not replaced as such.</p>

<p>Back to our previous example. The RPC client calls a specific Plugin function called Greet for which the implementation will be provided by a Server that will be streamed back over the RPC protocol.</p>

<p>The server is pretty easy to follow:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Here is the RPC server that GreeterRPC talks to, conforming to
// the requirements of net/rpc
type GreeterRPCServer struct {
	// This is the real implementation
	Impl Greeter
}
</code></pre>

<p>Impl is the concrete implementation that will be called in the Server&rsquo;s implementation of the Greet plugin. Now we must define Greet on the RPCServer in order for it to be able to call the remote code. This looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func (s *GreeterRPCServer) Greet(args interface{}, resp *string) error {
	*resp = s.Impl.Greet()
	return nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is all still boilerplate for the RPC works. Now comes plugin. For this, the comment is actually quite good too:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// This is the implementation of plugin.Plugin so we can serve/consume this
//
// This has two methods: Server must return an RPC server for this plugin
// type. We construct a GreeterRPCServer for this.
//
// Client must return an implementation of our interface that communicates
// over an RPC client. We return GreeterRPC for this.
//
// Ignore MuxBroker. That is used to create more multiplexed streams on our
// plugin connection and is a more advanced use case.
type GreeterPlugin struct {
	// Impl Injection
	Impl Greeter
}

func (p *GreeterPlugin) Server(*plugin.MuxBroker) (interface{}, error) {
	return &amp;GreeterRPCServer{Impl: p.Impl}, nil
}

func (GreeterPlugin) Client(b *plugin.MuxBroker, c *rpc.Client) (interface{}, error) {
	return &amp;GreeterRPC{client: c}, nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>What does this mean? So, remember: <code>GreeterRPCServer</code> is the one calling the actual implementation while Client is receiving the result of that call. The <code>GreeterPlugin</code> has the <code>Greeter</code> interface embedded just like the <code>RPCServer</code>. We will use the <code>GreeterPlugin</code> as a struct in the plugin map. This is the plugin that we will actually use.</p>

<p>This is all still common stuff. These things will need to be visible for both. The plugin&rsquo;s implementation will use the interface to see what it needs to implement. The Client will use it see what to call and what API is available. Like, <code>Greet</code>.</p>

<p>How does the implementation look like?</p>

<h3 id="the-implementation">The Implementation</h3>

<p>In a completely separate package, but which still has access to the interface definition, this plugin could be something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Here is a real implementation of Greeter
type GreeterHello struct {
	logger hclog.Logger
}

func (g *GreeterHello) Greet() string {
	g.logger.Debug(&quot;message from GreeterHello.Greet&quot;)
	return &quot;Hello!&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We create a struct and then add the function to it which is defined by the plugin&rsquo;s interface. This interface, since it&rsquo;s required by both parties, could well sit in a common package outside of both programs. Something like a SDK. Both code could import it and use it as a common dependency. This way we have separated the interface from the plugin <strong>and</strong> the calling client.</p>

<p>The <code>main</code> function could look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">logger := hclog.New(&amp;hclog.LoggerOptions{
    Level:      hclog.Trace,
    Output:     os.Stderr,
    JSONFormat: true,
})

greeter := &amp;GreeterHello{
    logger: logger,
}
// pluginMap is the map of plugins we can dispense.
var pluginMap = map[string]plugin.Plugin{
    &quot;greeter&quot;: &amp;example.GreeterPlugin{Impl: greeter},
}

logger.Debug(&quot;message from plugin&quot;, &quot;foo&quot;, &quot;bar&quot;)

plugin.Serve(&amp;plugin.ServeConfig{
    HandshakeConfig: handshakeConfig,
    Plugins:         pluginMap,
})
</code></pre>

<p>Notice two things that we need. One is the <code>handshakeConfig</code>. You can either define it here, with the same cookie details as you defined in the client code, or you can extract the handshake information into the SDK. This is up to you.</p>

<p>Then the next interesting thing is the <code>plugin.Serve</code> method. This is where the magic happens. The plugins open up a RPC communication socket and over a hijacked <code>stdout</code>, broadcasts its availability to the calling Client in this format:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">CORE-PROTOCOL-VERSION | APP-PROTOCOL-VERSION | NETWORK-TYPE | NETWORK-ADDR | PROTOCOL
</code></pre>

<p>For Go plugins, you don&rsquo;t have to concern yourself with this. <code>go-plugin</code> takes care of all this for you. For non-Go versions, we must take this into account. And before calling serve, we need to output this information to <code>stdout</code>.</p>

<p>For example, a Python plugin must deal with this himself. Like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># Output information
print(&quot;1|1|tcp|127.0.0.1:1234|grpc&quot;)
sys.stdout.flush()
</code></pre>

<p>For GRPC plugins, it&rsquo;s also mandatory to implement a HealthChecker.</p>

<p>How would all this look like with GRPC?</p>

<p>It gets slightly more complicated but not too much. We need to use <code>protoc</code> to create a protocol description for our implementation, and then we will call that. Let&rsquo;s look at this now by converting the basic greeter example into GRPC.</p>

<h1 id="grpc-basic-plugin">GRPC Basic plugin</h1>

<p>The example that&rsquo;s under GRPC is quite elaborate and perhaps you don&rsquo;t need the Python part. I will focus on the basic RPC example into a GRPC example. That should not be a problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-api">The API</h2>

<p>First and foremost, you will need to define an API to implement with <code>protoc</code>. For our basic example, the protoc file could look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-proto3">syntax = &quot;proto3&quot;;
package proto;

message GreetResponse {
    string message = 1;
}

message Empty {}

service GreeterService {
    rpc Greet(Empty) returns (GreetResponse);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax is quite simple and readable. What this defines is a message, which is a response, that will contain a <code>message</code> with the type <code>string</code>. The <code>service</code> defines a service which has a method called <code>Greet</code>. The service definition is basically an interface for which we will be providing the concrete implementation through the plugin.</p>

<p>To read more about protoc, visit this page: <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/">Google Protocol Buffer</a>.</p>

<h2 id="generate-the-code">Generate the code</h2>

<p>Now, with the protoc definition in hand, we need to generate the stubs that the local client implementation can call. That client call will then, through the remote procedure call, call the right function on the server which will have the concrete implementation at the ready. Run it and return the result in the specified format. Because the stub needs to be available by both parties, (the client AND the server), this needs to live in a shared location.</p>

<p>Why? Because the client is calling the stub and the server is implementing the stub. Both need it in order to know what to call/implement.</p>

<p>To generate the code, run this command:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">protoc -I proto/ proto/greeter.proto --go_out=plugins=grpc:proto
</code></pre>

<p>I encourage you to read the generated code. Much will make little sense at first. It will have a bunch of structs and defined things that the GRPC package will use in order to server the function. The interesting bits and pieces are:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func (m *GreetResponse) GetMessage() string {
	if m != nil {
		return m.Message
	}
	return &quot;&quot;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which will get use the message inside the response.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type GreeterServiceClient interface {
	Greet(ctx context.Context, in *Empty, opts ...grpc.CallOption) (*GreetResponse, error)
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is our ServiceClient interface which defines the Greet function’s topology.</p>

<p>And lastly, this guy:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func RegisterGreeterServiceServer(s *grpc.Server, srv GreeterServiceServer) {
	s.RegisterService(&amp;_GreeterService_serviceDesc, srv)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which we will need in order to register our implementation for the server. We can ignore the rest.</p>

<h2 id="the-interface-1">The interface</h2>

<p>Much like the RPC, we need to define an interface for the client and server to use. This must be in a shared place as both the server and the client need to know about it. You could put this into an SDK and your peers could just get the SDK and implement some function for define and done. The interface definition in the GRPC land could look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Greeter is the interface that we're exposing as a plugin.
type Greeter interface {
	Greet() string
}

// This is the implementation of plugin.GRPCPlugin so we can serve/consume this.
type GreeterGRPCPlugin struct {
	// GRPCPlugin must still implement the Plugin interface
	plugin.Plugin
	// Concrete implementation, written in Go. This is only used for plugins
	// that are written in Go.
	Impl Greeter
}

func (p *GreeterGRPCPlugin) GRPCServer(broker *plugin.GRPCBroker, s *grpc.Server) error {
	proto.RegisterGreeterServer(s, &amp;GRPCServer{Impl: p.Impl})
	return nil
}

func (p *GreeterGRPCPlugin) GRPCClient(ctx context.Context, broker *plugin.GRPCBroker, c *grpc.ClientConn) (interface{}, error) {
	return &amp;GRPCClient{client: proto.NewGreeterClient(c)}, nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>With this we have the Plugin&rsquo;s implementation for hashicorp what needed to be done. The plugin will call the underlying implementation and serve/consume the plugin. We can now write the GRPC part of it.</p>

<p>Please note that <code>proto</code> is a shared library too where the protocol stubs reside. That needs to be somewhere on the path or in a separate SDK of some sort, but it must be visible.</p>

<h2 id="writing-the-grpc-client">Writing the GRPC Client</h2>

<p>Firstly we define the grpc client struct:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// GRPCClient is an implementation of Greeter that talks over RPC.
type GRPCClient struct{ client proto.GreeterClient }
</code></pre>

<p>Then we define how the client will call the remote function:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func (m *GRPCClient) Greet() string {
	ret, _ := m.client.Greet(context.Background(), &amp;proto.Empty{})
	return ret.Message
}
</code></pre>

<p>This will take the <code>client</code> in the <code>GRPCClient</code> and will call the method on it. Once that&rsquo;s done we will return to the result <code>Message</code> property which will be <code>Hello!</code>. <code>proto.Empty</code> is an empty struct; we use this if there is no parameter for a defined method or no return value. We can&rsquo;t just leave it blank. <code>protoc</code> needs to be told explicitly that there is no parameter or return value.</p>

<h2 id="writing-the-grpc-server">Writing the GRPC Server</h2>

<p>The server implementation will also be similar. We call <code>Impl</code> here which will have our concrete plugin implementation.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Here is the gRPC server that GRPCClient talks to.
type GRPCServer struct {
	// This is the real implementation
	Impl Greeter
}

func (m *GRPCServer) Greet(
	ctx context.Context,
	req *proto.Empty) *proto.GreeterResponse {
	v := m.Impl.Greet()
	return &amp;proto.GreeterResponse{Message: v}
}
</code></pre>

<p>And we will use the <code>protoc</code> defined message response. <code>v</code> will have the response from <code>Greet</code> which will be <code>Hello!</code> provided by the concrete plugin&rsquo;s implementation. We then transform that into a protoc type by setting the <code>Message</code> property on the <code>GreeterResponse</code> struct provided by the automatically generated protoc stub code.</p>

<p>Easy, right?</p>

<h2 id="writing-the-plugin-itself">Writing the plugin itself</h2>

<p>The whole thing looks much like the RPC implementation with just a few small modifications and changes. This can sit completely outside of everything, or can even be provided by a third party implementor.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Here is a real implementation of KV that writes to a local file with
// the key name and the contents are the value of the key.
type Greeter struct{}

func (Greeter) Greet() error {
	return &quot;Hello!&quot;
}

func main() {
	plugin.Serve(&amp;plugin.ServeConfig{
		HandshakeConfig: shared.Handshake,
		Plugins: map[string]plugin.Plugin{
			&quot;greeter&quot;: &amp;shared.GreeterGRPCPlugin{Impl: &amp;Greeter{}},
		},

		// A non-nil value here enables gRPC serving for this plugin...
		GRPCServer: plugin.DefaultGRPCServer,
	})
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="calling-it-all-in-the-main">Calling it all in the main</h2>

<p>Once all that is done, the <code>main</code> function looks the same as RPC&rsquo;s main but with some small modifications.</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	// We're a host. Start by launching the plugin process.
	client := plugin.NewClient(&amp;plugin.ClientConfig{
		HandshakeConfig: shared.Handshake,
		Plugins:         shared.PluginMap,
		Cmd:             exec.Command(&quot;./plugin/greeter&quot;),
		AllowedProtocols: []plugin.Protocol{plugin.ProtocolGRPC},
	})
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>NewClient</code> now defines <code>AllowedProtocols</code> to be <code>ProtocolGRPC</code>. The rest is the same as before calling <code>Dispense</code> and value hinting the plugin to the correct type then calling <code>Greet()</code>.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This is it. We made it! Now our plugin works over GRPC with a defined API by protoc. The plugin&rsquo;s implementation can live where ever we want it to, but it needs some shared data. These are:</p>

<ul>
<li>The generated code by <code>protoc</code></li>
<li>The defined plugin interface</li>
<li>The GRPC Server and Client</li>
</ul>

<p>These need to be visible by both the Client and the Server. The Server here is the plugin. If you are planning on making people be able to extend your application with go-plugin, you should make these available as a separate SDK. So people won&rsquo;t have to include your whole project just to implement an interface and use protoc. In fact, you could also extract the <code>protoc</code> definition into a separate repository so that your SDK can also pull it in.</p>

<p>You will have three repositories:
* Your application;
* The SDK providing the interface and the GRPC Server and Client implementation;
* The protoc definition file and generated skeleton ( for Go based plugins).</p>

<p>Other languages will have to generate their own protoc code, and includ it into the plugin; like the Python implementation example located here: <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin/tree/master/examples/grpc/plugin-python">Go-plugin Python Example</a>. Also, read this documentation carefully: <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin/blob/master/docs/guide-plugin-write-non-go.md">non-go go-plugin</a>. This document will also clarify what <code>1|1|tcp|127.0.0.1:1234|grpc</code> means and will dissipate the confusion around how plugins work.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you would like to have an in-depth explanation about how go-plugin came to be, watch this video by Mitchell:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRvm3zQQc1Q">go-plugin explanation video</a>.</p>

<p>I must warn you though- it&rsquo;s an hour long. But worth the watch!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. I hope this has helped to clear the confusion around how to use go-plugin.</p>

<p>Happy plugging!</p>

                        <p>Hi.</p>

<p>A quick update, but a very important and interesting one hopefully. Furnace just got a massive boost to its plugin system.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin">HashiCorp&rsquo;s Go-Plugins</a> system now to handle plugins. This means one of
two things that are interesting to the plugin author.</p>

<p>One, plugins can be written in any language which is supported by Furnace and supports GRPC. Currently this means that
plugins can be written in the following languages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Go</p></li>

<li><p>Python</p></li>

<li><p>Ruby</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Adding new plugins is easy and I&rsquo;m open for suggestions in which language to provide next if the need arrises.</p>

<p>To find out more, please read the README on Furnace about plugins located here: <a href="https://github.com/go-furnace/go-furnace/blob/master/README.md#plugins">Furnace Plugin
System</a>.</p>

<p>I hope to see a bunch of nice plugins pop up here and there if please are interested in writing them. I&rsquo;m listing a couple of
possibilities like, notification after create, or resource cleanup or even preventing the stack from creating in the first place
with a pre-create check for permissions / resource availability / funds constraints.</p>

<p>Have fun writing plugins and making Furnace more powerful then ever.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m planning on providing some basic plugins that could be used out of the box. Those will probably be in Go though.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Gergely.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Previously on this blog: <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/16/building-furnace-part-1/">Part 1</a>. <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/19/building-furnace-part-2/">Part 2</a>. <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/22/building-furnace-part-3/">Part 3</a>.</p>

<p>In this part we are going to talk about Unit Testing Furnace and how to work some magic with AWS and Go.</p>

<h1 id="mock-stub-fake-dummy-canned-insert-name-here">Mock Stub Fake Dummy Canned <Insert Name Here></h1>

<p>Unit testing in Go usually follows the Dependency Injection model of dealing with Mocks and Stubs.</p>

<p>## DI</p>

<p>Dependency Inject in short is one object supplying the dependencies of another object. In a longer description, it&rsquo;s ideal to be used
for removing the lock on a third party library, like the AWS client. Imaging having code which solely depends on the AWS client. How
would you unit test that code without having to ACTUALLY connect to AWS? You couldn&rsquo;t. Every time you try to test the code it would run
the live code and it would try and connect to AWS and perform the operations it&rsquo;s design to do. The Ruby library with it&rsquo;s metaprogramming
allows you to set the client globally to stub responses, but, alas, this is not the world of Ruby.</p>

<p>Here is where DI comes to the rescue. If you have control over the AWS client on a very high level, and would pass it around as a function
parameter, or create that client in an <code>init()</code> function and have it globally defined; you would be able to implement your own client, and
have your code use that with stubbed responses which your tests need. For example, you would like a CreateApplication call to fail, or you
would like a DescribeStack which returns an aws.Error(&ldquo;StackAlreadyExists&rdquo;).</p>

<p>For this, however, you need the API of the AWS client. Which is provided by AWS.</p>

<h2 id="aws-client-api">AWS Client API</h2>

<p>In order for DI to work, the injected object needs to be of a certain type for us to inject our own. Luckily, AWS provides an Interface for
all of it&rsquo;s clients. Meaning, we can implement our own version for all of the clients, like S3, CloudFormation, CodeDeploy etc.</p>

<p>For each client you want to mock out, an <em>*iface</em> package should be present like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">  &quot;github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/cloudformation/cloudformationiface&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>In this package you find and use the interface like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type fakeCloudFormationClient struct {
	cloudformationiface.CloudFormationAPI
	err error
}
</code></pre>

<p>And with this, we have our own CloudFormation client. The real code uses the real clients as function parameters, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Execute defines what this command does.
func (c *Create) Execute(opts *commander.CommandHelper) {
	log.Println(&quot;Creating cloud formation session.&quot;)
	sess := session.New(&amp;aws.Config{Region: aws.String(config.REGION)})
	cfClient := cloudformation.New(sess, nil)
	client := CFClient{cfClient}
	createExecute(opts, &amp;client)
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can&rsquo;t test Execute itself, as it&rsquo;s using the real client here (or you could have a global from some library, thus allowing you to tests
even <code>Execute</code> here) but there is very little logic in this function for this very reason. All the logic is in small functions for which
the main starting point and our testing opportunity is, <code>createExecute</code>.</p>

<h2 id="stubbing-calls">Stubbing Calls</h2>

<p>Now, that we have our own client, and with the power of Go&rsquo;s interface embedding as seen above with CloudFormationAPI, we have to only stub
the functions which we are actually using, instead of every function of the given interface. This looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	cfClient := new(CFClient)
	cfClient.Client = &amp;fakeCloudFormationClient{err: nil}
</code></pre>

<p>Where cfClient is a struct like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// CFClient abstraction for cloudFormation client.
type CFClient struct {
	Client cloudformationiface.CloudFormationAPI
}
</code></pre>

<p>And a stubbed call can than be written as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func (fc *fakeCreateCFClient) WaitUntilStackCreateComplete(input *cloudformation.DescribeStacksInput) error {
	return nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>This can range from a very trivial example, like the one above, to intricate ones as well, like this gem:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func (fc *fakePushCFClient) ListStackResources(input *cloudformation.ListStackResourcesInput) (*cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput, error) {
	if &quot;NoASG&quot; == *input.StackName {
		return &amp;cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput{
			StackResourceSummaries: []*cloudformation.StackResourceSummary{
				{
					ResourceType:       aws.String(&quot;NoASG&quot;),
					PhysicalResourceId: aws.String(&quot;arn::whatever&quot;),
				},
			},
		}, fc.err
	}
	return &amp;cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput{
		StackResourceSummaries: []*cloudformation.StackResourceSummary{
			{
				ResourceType:       aws.String(&quot;AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup&quot;),
				PhysicalResourceId: aws.String(&quot;arn::whatever&quot;),
			},
		},
	}, fc.err
}
</code></pre>

<p>This ListStackResources stub lets us test two scenarios based on the stackname. If the test stackname is &lsquo;NoASG&rsquo; it will return a result
which equals to a result containing no AutoScaling Group. Otherwise, it will return the correct ResourceType for an ASG.</p>

<p>It is a common practice to line up several scenario based stubbed responses in order to test the robustness of your code.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this also means that your tests will be a bit cluttered with stubs and mock structs and whatnots. For that, I&rsquo;m partially
using a package available struct file in which I&rsquo;m defining most of the mock structs at least. And from there on, the tests will only contain
specific stubs for that particular file. This can be further fine grained by having defaults and than only override in case you need something
else.</p>

<h1 id="testing-fatals">Testing fatals</h1>

<p>Now, the other point which is not really AWS related, but still comes to mind when dealing with Furnace, is testing error scenarios.</p>

<p>Because Furnace is a CLI application it uses Fatals to signal if something is wrong and it doesn&rsquo;t want to continue or recover because, frankly
it can&rsquo;t. If AWS throws an error, that&rsquo;s it. You can retry, but in 90% of the cases, it&rsquo;s usually something that you messed up.</p>

<p>So, how do we test for a fatal or an <code>os.Exit</code>? There are a number of points on that if you do a quick search. You may end up on this talk:
<a href="https://talks.golang.org/2014/testing.slide#23">GoTalk 2014 Testing Slide #23</a>. Which does an interesting thing. It calls the test binary in a
separate process and tests the exit code.</p>

<p>Others, and me as well, will say that you have to have your own logger implemented and use a different logger / os.Exit in your test environment.</p>

<p>Others others will tell you to not to have tests around os.Exit and fatal things, rather return an error and only the main should pop a world
ending event. I leave it up to you which you want to use. Either is fine.</p>

<p>In Furnace, I&rsquo;m using a global logger in my error handling util like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// HandleFatal handler fatal errors in Furnace.
func HandleFatal(s string, err error) {
	LogFatalf(s, err)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>LogFatalf</code> is an exported variable <code>var LogFatalf = log.Fatalf</code>. Than in a test, I just override this variable with a local anonymous
function:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func TestCreateExecuteEmptyStack(t *testing.T) {
	failed := false
	utils.LogFatalf = func(s string, a ...interface{}) {
		failed = true
	}
	config.WAITFREQUENCY = 0
	client := new(CFClient)
	stackname := &quot;EmptyStack&quot;
	client.Client = &amp;fakeCreateCFClient{err: nil, stackname: stackname}
	opts := &amp;commander.CommandHelper{}
	createExecute(opts, client)
	if !failed {
		t.Error(&quot;expected outcome to fail during create&quot;)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>It can get even more granular by testing for the error message to make sure that it actually fails at the point we think we are
testing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func TestCreateStackReturnsWithError(t *testing.T) {
	failed := false
	expectedMessage := &quot;failed to create stack&quot;
	var message string
	utils.LogFatalf = func(s string, a ...interface{}) {
		failed = true
		if err, ok := a[0].(error); ok {
			message = err.Error()
		}
	}
	config.WAITFREQUENCY = 0
	client := new(CFClient)
	stackname := &quot;NotEmptyStack&quot;
	client.Client = &amp;fakeCreateCFClient{err: errors.New(expectedMessage), stackname: stackname}
	config := []byte(&quot;{}&quot;)
	create(stackname, config, client)
	if !failed {
		t.Error(&quot;expected outcome to fail&quot;)
	}
	if message != expectedMessage {
		t.Errorf(&quot;message did not equal expected message of '%s', was:%s&quot;, expectedMessage, message)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This is it. That&rsquo;s all it took to write Furnace. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing all these thoughts down.</p>

<p>I hope somebody might learn from my journey and also improve upon it.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Previously on this blog: <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/16/building-furnace-part-1/">Part 1</a>. <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/19/building-furnace-part-2/">Part 2</a>. <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/22/building-furnace-part-3/">Part 3</a>.</p>

<p>In this part we are going to talk about Unit Testing Furnace and how to work some magic with AWS and Go.</p>

<h1 id="mock-stub-fake-dummy-canned-insert-name-here">Mock Stub Fake Dummy Canned <Insert Name Here></h1>

<p>Unit testing in Go usually follows the Dependency Injection model of dealing with Mocks and Stubs.</p>

<p>## DI</p>

<p>Dependency Inject in short is one object supplying the dependencies of another object. In a longer description, it&rsquo;s ideal to be used
for removing the lock on a third party library, like the AWS client. Imaging having code which solely depends on the AWS client. How
would you unit test that code without having to ACTUALLY connect to AWS? You couldn&rsquo;t. Every time you try to test the code it would run
the live code and it would try and connect to AWS and perform the operations it&rsquo;s design to do. The Ruby library with it&rsquo;s metaprogramming
allows you to set the client globally to stub responses, but, alas, this is not the world of Ruby.</p>

<p>Here is where DI comes to the rescue. If you have control over the AWS client on a very high level, and would pass it around as a function
parameter, or create that client in an <code>init()</code> function and have it globally defined; you would be able to implement your own client, and
have your code use that with stubbed responses which your tests need. For example, you would like a CreateApplication call to fail, or you
would like a DescribeStack which returns an aws.Error(&ldquo;StackAlreadyExists&rdquo;).</p>

<p>For this, however, you need the API of the AWS client. Which is provided by AWS.</p>

<h2 id="aws-client-api">AWS Client API</h2>

<p>In order for DI to work, the injected object needs to be of a certain type for us to inject our own. Luckily, AWS provides an Interface for
all of it&rsquo;s clients. Meaning, we can implement our own version for all of the clients, like S3, CloudFormation, CodeDeploy etc.</p>

<p>For each client you want to mock out, an <em>*iface</em> package should be present like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">  &quot;github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/cloudformation/cloudformationiface&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>In this package you find and use the interface like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type fakeCloudFormationClient struct {
	cloudformationiface.CloudFormationAPI
	err error
}
</code></pre>

<p>And with this, we have our own CloudFormation client. The real code uses the real clients as function parameters, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Execute defines what this command does.
func (c *Create) Execute(opts *commander.CommandHelper) {
	log.Println(&quot;Creating cloud formation session.&quot;)
	sess := session.New(&amp;aws.Config{Region: aws.String(config.REGION)})
	cfClient := cloudformation.New(sess, nil)
	client := CFClient{cfClient}
	createExecute(opts, &amp;client)
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can&rsquo;t test Execute itself, as it&rsquo;s using the real client here (or you could have a global from some library, thus allowing you to tests
even <code>Execute</code> here) but there is very little logic in this function for this very reason. All the logic is in small functions for which
the main starting point and our testing opportunity is, <code>createExecute</code>.</p>

<h2 id="stubbing-calls">Stubbing Calls</h2>

<p>Now, that we have our own client, and with the power of Go&rsquo;s interface embedding as seen above with CloudFormationAPI, we have to only stub
the functions which we are actually using, instead of every function of the given interface. This looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	cfClient := new(CFClient)
	cfClient.Client = &amp;fakeCloudFormationClient{err: nil}
</code></pre>

<p>Where cfClient is a struct like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// CFClient abstraction for cloudFormation client.
type CFClient struct {
	Client cloudformationiface.CloudFormationAPI
}
</code></pre>

<p>And a stubbed call can than be written as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func (fc *fakeCreateCFClient) WaitUntilStackCreateComplete(input *cloudformation.DescribeStacksInput) error {
	return nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>This can range from a very trivial example, like the one above, to intricate ones as well, like this gem:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func (fc *fakePushCFClient) ListStackResources(input *cloudformation.ListStackResourcesInput) (*cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput, error) {
	if &quot;NoASG&quot; == *input.StackName {
		return &amp;cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput{
			StackResourceSummaries: []*cloudformation.StackResourceSummary{
				{
					ResourceType:       aws.String(&quot;NoASG&quot;),
					PhysicalResourceId: aws.String(&quot;arn::whatever&quot;),
				},
			},
		}, fc.err
	}
	return &amp;cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput{
		StackResourceSummaries: []*cloudformation.StackResourceSummary{
			{
				ResourceType:       aws.String(&quot;AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup&quot;),
				PhysicalResourceId: aws.String(&quot;arn::whatever&quot;),
			},
		},
	}, fc.err
}
</code></pre>

<p>This ListStackResources stub lets us test two scenarios based on the stackname. If the test stackname is &lsquo;NoASG&rsquo; it will return a result
which equals to a result containing no AutoScaling Group. Otherwise, it will return the correct ResourceType for an ASG.</p>

<p>It is a common practice to line up several scenario based stubbed responses in order to test the robustness of your code.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this also means that your tests will be a bit cluttered with stubs and mock structs and whatnots. For that, I&rsquo;m partially
using a package available struct file in which I&rsquo;m defining most of the mock structs at least. And from there on, the tests will only contain
specific stubs for that particular file. This can be further fine grained by having defaults and than only override in case you need something
else.</p>

<h1 id="testing-fatals">Testing fatals</h1>

<p>Now, the other point which is not really AWS related, but still comes to mind when dealing with Furnace, is testing error scenarios.</p>

<p>Because Furnace is a CLI application it uses Fatals to signal if something is wrong and it doesn&rsquo;t want to continue or recover because, frankly
it can&rsquo;t. If AWS throws an error, that&rsquo;s it. You can retry, but in 90% of the cases, it&rsquo;s usually something that you messed up.</p>

<p>So, how do we test for a fatal or an <code>os.Exit</code>? There are a number of points on that if you do a quick search. You may end up on this talk:
<a href="https://talks.golang.org/2014/testing.slide#23">GoTalk 2014 Testing Slide #23</a>. Which does an interesting thing. It calls the test binary in a
separate process and tests the exit code.</p>

<p>Others, and me as well, will say that you have to have your own logger implemented and use a different logger / os.Exit in your test environment.</p>

<p>Others others will tell you to not to have tests around os.Exit and fatal things, rather return an error and only the main should pop a world
ending event. I leave it up to you which you want to use. Either is fine.</p>

<p>In Furnace, I&rsquo;m using a global logger in my error handling util like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// HandleFatal handler fatal errors in Furnace.
func HandleFatal(s string, err error) {
	LogFatalf(s, err)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>LogFatalf</code> is an exported variable <code>var LogFatalf = log.Fatalf</code>. Than in a test, I just override this variable with a local anonymous
function:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func TestCreateExecuteEmptyStack(t *testing.T) {
	failed := false
	utils.LogFatalf = func(s string, a ...interface{}) {
		failed = true
	}
	config.WAITFREQUENCY = 0
	client := new(CFClient)
	stackname := &quot;EmptyStack&quot;
	client.Client = &amp;fakeCreateCFClient{err: nil, stackname: stackname}
	opts := &amp;commander.CommandHelper{}
	createExecute(opts, client)
	if !failed {
		t.Error(&quot;expected outcome to fail during create&quot;)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>It can get even more granular by testing for the error message to make sure that it actually fails at the point we think we are
testing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func TestCreateStackReturnsWithError(t *testing.T) {
	failed := false
	expectedMessage := &quot;failed to create stack&quot;
	var message string
	utils.LogFatalf = func(s string, a ...interface{}) {
		failed = true
		if err, ok := a[0].(error); ok {
			message = err.Error()
		}
	}
	config.WAITFREQUENCY = 0
	client := new(CFClient)
	stackname := &quot;NotEmptyStack&quot;
	client.Client = &amp;fakeCreateCFClient{err: errors.New(expectedMessage), stackname: stackname}
	config := []byte(&quot;{}&quot;)
	create(stackname, config, client)
	if !failed {
		t.Error(&quot;expected outcome to fail&quot;)
	}
	if message != expectedMessage {
		t.Errorf(&quot;message did not equal expected message of '%s', was:%s&quot;, expectedMessage, message)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This is it. That&rsquo;s all it took to write Furnace. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing all these thoughts down.</p>

<p>I hope somebody might learn from my journey and also improve upon it.</p>

<p>Any comments are much appreciated and welcomed. Also, PRs and Issues can be submitted on the GitHub page of <a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/go-furnace">Furnace</a>.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Previously on this blog: <a href="http://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/16/building-furnace-part-1/">Part 1</a>. <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/19/building-furnace-part-2/">Part 2</a>. <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/04/16/building-furnace-part-4/">Part 4</a>.</p>

<p>In this part, I&rsquo;m going to talk about the experimental plugin system of Furnace.</p>

<h1 id="go-experimental-plugins">Go Experimental Plugins</h1>

<p>Since Go 1.8 was released, an exciting and new feature was introduced called a Plug-in system. This system works with dynamic
libraries built with a special switch to <code>go build</code>. These libraries, <code>.so</code> or <code>.dylib</code> (later), are than loaded and once that
succeeds, specific functions can be called from them (symbol resolution).</p>

<p>We will see how this works. For package information, visit the plugin packages Go doc page
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/plugin/">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="furnace-plugins">Furnace Plugins</h1>

<p>So, what does furnace use plugins for? Furnace uses plugins to execute arbitery code in, currently, four given locations / events.</p>

<p>These are: <code>pre_create, post_create, pre_delete, post_delete</code>. These events are called, as their name suggests, before and after
the creation and deletion of the CloudFormation stack. It allows the user to execute some code without having to rebuild the whole
project. It does that by defining a single entry point for the custom code called <code>RunPlugin</code>. Any number of functions can be
implemented, but the plugin MUST provide this single, exported function. Otherwise it will fail and ignore that plugin.</p>

<h2 id="using-plugins">Using Plugins</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s really easy to implement, and use these plugins. I&rsquo;m not going into the detail of how to load them, because that is done by
Furnace, but only how to write and use them.</p>

<p>To use a plugin, create a go file called: <code>0001_mailer.go</code>. The <code>0001</code> before it will define WHEN it&rsquo;s executed.
Having multiple plugins is completely okay. Execution of order however, depends on the names of the files.</p>

<p>Now, in 0001_mailer.post_create we would have something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import &quot;log&quot;

// RunPlugin runs the plugin.
func RunPlugin() {
	log.Println(&quot;My Awesome Pre Create Plugin.&quot;)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next step is the build this file to be a plugin library. Note: Right now, this only works on Linux!</p>

<p>To build this file run the following:</p>

<pre><code>go build -buildmode=plugin -o 0001_mailer.pre_create 0001_mailer.go
</code></pre>

<p>The important part here is the extension of the file specified with <code>-o</code>. It&rsquo;s important because that&rsquo;s how Furnace identifies
what plugins it has to run.</p>

<p>Finally, copy this file to <code>~/.config/go-furnace/plugins</code> and you are all set.</p>

<h2 id="slack-notification-plugin">Slack notification Plugin</h2>

<p>To demonstrate how a plugin could be used is if you need some kind of notification once a Stack is completed. For example, you
might want to send a message to a Slack room. To do this, your plugin would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;os&quot;

	&quot;github.com/nlopes/slack&quot;
)

func RunPlugin() {
	stackname := os.Getenv(&quot;FURNACE_STACKNAME&quot;)
	api := slack.New(&quot;YOUR_TOKEN_HERE&quot;)
	params := slack.PostMessageParameters{}
	channelID, timestamp, err := api.PostMessage(&quot;#general&quot;, fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Stack with name '%s' is Done.&quot;, stackname), params)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf(&quot;Message successfully sent to channel %s at %s&quot;, channelID, timestamp)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, Furnace has no ability to share information of the stack with an outside plugin. Thus &lsquo;Done&rsquo; could be anything from
Rollback to Failed to CreateComplete.</p>

<h1 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h1>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for plugins. Thanks very much for reading!

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Previously on this blog: <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/16/building-furnace-part-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/22/building-furnace-part-3/">Part 3</a>, <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/04/16/building-furnace-part-4/">Part 4</a></p>

<p>In this part, I&rsquo;m going to talk about the AWS Go SDK and begin do dissect the intricacies of Furnace.</p>

<h1 id="aws-sdk">AWS SDK</h1>

<p>Fortunately, the Go SDK for AWS is quiet verbose and littered with examples of all sorts. But that doesn&rsquo;t make it less complex
and less cryptic at times. I&rsquo;m here to lift some of the early confusions, in hopes that I can help someone to avoid wasting time.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-and-developers-guide">Getting Started and Developers Guide</h2>

<p>As always, and common from AWS, the documentation is top notch. There is a 141 pages long developer&rsquo;s guide on the SDK containing
a getting started section and an API reference. Go check it out. I&rsquo;ll wait. <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/aws-sdk-go-dg.pdf">AWS Go SDK DG PDF</a>. I will only talk about some gotchas and things I encountered, not the basics of the SDK.</p>

<h2 id="aws-string-and-other-types">aws.String and other types</h2>

<p>Something which is immediately visible once we take a look at the API is that everything is a pointer. Now, there are a
tremendous amount of discussions about this, but I&rsquo;m with Amazon. There are various reasons for it, but to list the most prominent
ones:
    - Type completion and compile time type safety.
    - Values for AWS API calls have valid zero values, in addition to being optional, i.e. not being provided at all.
    - Other option, like, empty interfaces with maps, or using zero values, or struct wrappers around every type, made life much
       harder rather than easier or not possible at all.
    - The AWS API is volatile. You never know when something gets to be optional, or required. Pointers made that decision easy.</p>

<p>There are good number of other discussions around this topic, for example: <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/363">AWS Go GitHub #363</a>.</p>

<p>In order to use primitives, AWS has helper functions like <code>aws.String</code>. Because &amp;&ldquo;asdf&rdquo; is not allowed, you would have to create a
variable and use its address in situations where a string pointer is needed, for example, name of the stack. These primitive helpers will
make in-lining possible. We&rsquo;ll see later that they are used to a great extent. Pointers, however, make life a bit difficult when
constructing Input structs and make for poor aesthetics.</p>

<p>This is something I&rsquo;m returning in a test for stubbing a client call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">		return &amp;cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput{
			StackResourceSummaries: []*cloudformation.StackResourceSummary{
				{
					ResourceType:       aws.String(&quot;NoASG&quot;),
					PhysicalResourceId: aws.String(&quot;arn::whatever&quot;),
				},
			},
		}
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t look so appealing, but one gets used to it quickly.</p>

<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>

<p>Errors also have their own types. An AWS error looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">if err != nil {
    if awsErr, ok := err.(awserr.Error); ok {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>First, we check if error is nil, than we type check if the error is an AWS error or something different. In the wild, this will
look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	if err != nil {
		if awsErr, ok := err.(awserr.Error); ok {
			if awsErr.Code() != codedeploy.ErrCodeDeploymentGroupAlreadyExistsException {
				log.Println(awsErr.Code())
				return err
			}
			log.Println(&quot;DeploymentGroup already exists. Nothing to do.&quot;)
			return nil
		}
		return err
	}
</code></pre>

<p>If it&rsquo;s an AWS error, we can check further for the error code that it returns in order to identify what to handle, or what to throw
on to the caller to a potential fatal. Here, I&rsquo;m ignoring the AlreadyExistsException because, if it does, we just go on to a next
action.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Luckily the API doc is very mature. In most of the cases, they provide an example to an API call. These examples, however, from
time to time provide more confusion than clarity. Take CloudFormation. For me, when I first glanced upon the
description of the API it wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear that the <code>TemplateBody</code> was supposed to be the whole template, and that
the rest of the fields were almost all optional settings. Or provided overrides in special cases.</p>

<p>And since the template is not an ordinary JAML or JSON file, I was looking for something that parses it into that the Struct I
was going to use. After some time, and digging, I realized that I didn&rsquo;t need that, and that I just need to read in the template,
define some extra parameters, and give the TemplateBody the whole of the template. The parameters defined by the CloudFormation
template where extracted for me by <code>ValidateTemplate</code> API call which returned all of them in a convenient
<code>[]*cloudformation.Parameter</code> slice. These things are not described in the document or visible from the examples. I mainly found
them through playing with the API and focused experimentation.</p>

<h2 id="waiters">Waiters</h2>

<p>From other SDK implementations, we got used to Waiters. These handy methods wait for a service to become available or for certain
situations to take in effect, like a Stage being <code>CREATE_COMPLETE</code>. The Go waiters, however, don&rsquo;t allow for callback to be fired,
or for running blocks, like the ruby SDK does. For this, I wrote a handy little waiter for myself, which outputs a spinner to see
that we are currently waiting for something and not frozen in time. This waiter looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// WaitForFunctionWithStatusOutput waits for a function to complete its action.
func WaitForFunctionWithStatusOutput(state string, freq int, f func()) {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)
	done := make(chan bool)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		f()
		done &lt;- true
	}()
	go func() {
		counter := 0
		for {
			counter = (counter + 1) % len(Spinners[config.SPINNER])
			fmt.Printf(&quot;\r[%s] Waiting for state: %s&quot;, yellow(string(Spinners[config.SPINNER][counter])), red(state))
			time.Sleep(time.Duration(freq) * time.Second)
			select {
			case &lt;-done:
				fmt.Println()
				break
			default:
			}
		}
	}()

	wg.Wait()
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I&rsquo;m calling it with the following method:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	utils.WaitForFunctionWithStatusOutput(&quot;DELETE_COMPLETE&quot;, config.WAITFREQUENCY, func() {
		cfClient.Client.WaitUntilStackDeleteComplete(describeStackInput)
	})
</code></pre>

<p>This would output these lines to the console:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">[\] Waiting for state: DELETE_COMPLETE
</code></pre>

<p>The spinner can be configured to be one of the following types:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">var Spinners = []string{`←↖↑↗→↘↓↙`,
	`▁▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃`,
	`┤┘┴└├┌┬┐`,
	`◰◳◲◱`,
	`◴◷◶◵`,
	`◐◓◑◒`,
	`⣾⣽⣻⢿⡿⣟⣯⣷`,
	`|/-\`}
</code></pre>

<p>Handy.</p>

<p>And with that, let&rsquo;s dive into the basics of Furnace.</p>

<h1 id="furnace">Furnace</h1>

<h2 id="directory-structure-and-packages">Directory Structure and Packages</h2>

<p>Furnace is divided into three main packages.</p>

<h3 id="commands">commands</h3>

<p>Commands package is where the gist of Furnace lies. These commands represent the commands which are used through the CLI. Each
file has the implementation for one command. The structure is devised by this library: <a href="https://github.com/Yitsushi/go-commander">Yitsushi&rsquo;s Command Library</a>.
As of the writing of this post, the following commands are available:
- create - Creates a stack using the CloudFormation template file under ~/.config/go-furnace
- delete - Deletes the created Stack. Doesn&rsquo;t do anything if the stack doesn&rsquo;t exist
- push - Pushes an application to a stack
- status - Displays information about the stack
- delete-application - Deletes the CodeDeploy application and deployment group created by <code>push</code></p>

<p>These commands represent the heart of furnace. I would like to keep these to a minimum, but I do plan on adding more, like
<code>update</code> and <code>rollout</code>. Further details and help messages on these commands can be obtained by running: <code>./furnace help</code> or
<code>./furnace help create</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">❯ ./furnace help push
Usage: furnace push appName [-s3]

Push a version of the application to a stack

Examples:
  furnace push
  furnace push appName
  furnace push appName -s3
  furnace push -s3
</code></pre>

<h3 id="config">config</h3>

<p>Contains the configuration loader and some project wide defaults which are as follows:
- Events for the plugin system - <code>pre-create</code>, <code>post-create</code>, <code>pre-delete</code>, <code>post-delete</code>.
- CodeDeploy role name - <code>CodeDeployServiceRole</code>. This is used if none is provided to locate the CodeDeploy IAM role.
- Wait frequency - Is the setting which controls how long the waiter should sleep in between status updates. Default is <code>1s</code>.
- Spinner - Is just the number of the spinner to use.
- Plugin registry - Is a map of functions to run for the above events.</p>

<p>Further more, config loads the CloudFormation template and checks if some necessary settings are present in the environment, exp:
the configuration folder under <code>~/.config/go-furnace</code>.</p>

<h3 id="utils">utils</h3>

<p>These are some helper functions which are used throughout the project. To list them:
- error_handler - Is a simple error handler. I&rsquo;m thinking of refactoring this one to some saner version.
- spinner - Sets up which spinner to use in the waiter function.
- waiter - Contains the verbose waiter introduced above under <a href="##Waiters">Waiters</a>.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-and-environment-variables">Configuration and Environment variables</h2>

<p>Furnace is a Go application, thus it doesn&rsquo;t have the luxury of Ruby or Python where the configuration files are usually bundled
with the app. But, it does have a standard for it. Usually, configurations reside in either of these two locations. Environment
Properties or|and configuration files under a fixed location ( i.e. HOME/.config/app-name ). Furnace employs both.</p>

<p>Settings like, region, stack name, enable plugin system, are under environment properties ( though this can change ), while the
CloudFormation template lives under <code>~/.config/go-furnace/</code>. Lastly it assumes some things, like the Deployment IAM role just
exists under the used AWS account. All these are loaded and handled by the config package described above.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>A typical scenario for Furnace would be the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setup your CloudFormation template or use the one provided. The one provided sets up a highly available and self healing setting
using Auto-Scaling and Load-Balancing with a single application instance. Edit this template to your liking than copy it to
<code>~/.config/go-furnace</code>.</li>
<li>Create the configured stack with <code>./furnace create</code>.</li>
<li>Create will ask for the parameters defined in the template. If defaults are setup, simply hitting enter will use these defaults.
Take note, that the provided template sets up SSH access via a provided key. If that key is not present in CF, you won&rsquo;t be able
to SSH into the created instance.</li>
<li>Once the stack is completed, the application is ready to be pushed. To do this, run: <code>./furnace push</code>. This will locate the
appropriate version of the app from S3 or GitHub and push that version to the instances in the Auto-Scaling group. To all of
them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-practices-applied-to-the-project">General Practices Applied to the Project</h2>

<h3 id="commands-1">Commands</h3>

<p>For each command the main entry point is the <code>execute</code> function. These functions are usually calling out the small chunks of
distributed methods. Logic was kept to a bare minimum ( probably could be simplified even further ) in the execute functions
mostly for testability and the likes. We will see that in a followup post.</p>

<h3 id="errors">Errors</h3>

<p>Errors are handled immediately and usually through a fatal. If any error occurs than the application is halted. In followup
versions this might become more granular. I.e. don&rsquo;t immediately stop the world, maybe try to recover, or create a Poller or
Re-Tryer, which tries a call again for a configured amount of times.</p>

<h3 id="output-colors">Output colors</h3>

<p>Not that important, but still&hellip; Aesthetics. Displaying data to the console in a nice way gives it some extra flare.</p>

<h3 id="makefile">Makefile</h3>

<p>This project works with a Makefile for various reasons. Later on, once the project might become more complex, a Makefile makes it
really easy to handle different ways of packaging the application. Currently, for example, it provides a <code>linux</code> target which will
make Go build the project for Linux architecture on any other Architecture i.e. cross-compiling.</p>

<p>It also provides an easy way to run unit tests with <code>make test</code> and installing with <code>make &amp;&amp; make install</code>.</p>

<h1 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h1>

<p>That is all for Part 2. Join me in Part 3 where I will talk about the experimental Plugin system that Furnace employs.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Previously on this blog: <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/16/building-furnace-part-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/22/building-furnace-part-3/">Part 3</a>, <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/04/16/building-furnace-part-4/">Part 4</a></p>

<p>In this part, I&rsquo;m going to talk about the AWS Go SDK and begin do dissect the intricacies of Furnace.</p>

<h1 id="aws-sdk">AWS SDK</h1>

<p>Fortunately, the Go SDK for AWS is quiet verbose and littered with examples of all sorts. But that doesn&rsquo;t make it less complex
and less cryptic at times. I&rsquo;m here to lift some of the early confusions, in hopes that I can help someone to avoid wasting time.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-and-developers-guide">Getting Started and Developers Guide</h2>

<p>As always, and common from AWS, the documentation is top notch. There is a 141 pages long developer&rsquo;s guide on the SDK containing
a getting started section and an API reference. Go check it out. I&rsquo;ll wait. <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/aws-sdk-go-dg.pdf">AWS Go SDK DG PDF</a>. I will only talk about some gotchas and things I encountered, not the basics of the SDK.</p>

					PhysicalResourceId: aws.String(&quot;arn::whatever&quot;),
				},
			},
		}
</code></pre>

	}

			select {
			case &lt;-done:
				fmt.Println()
				break
			default:
			}
		}
	}()

	wg.Wait()
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I&rsquo;m calling it with the following method:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	utils.WaitForFunctionWithStatusOutput(&quot;DELETE_COMPLETE&quot;, config.WAITFREQUENCY, func() {
		cfClient.Client.WaitUntilStackDeleteComplete(describeStackInput)
	})
</code></pre>

<p>This would output these lines to the console:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">[\] Waiting for state: DELETE_COMPLETE
</code></pre>

<p>The spinner can be configured to be one of the following types:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">var Spinners = []string{`←↖↑↗→↘↓↙`,
	`▁▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃`,

	`◰◳◲◱`,
	`◴◷◶◵`,
	`◐◓◑◒`,

really easy to handle different ways of packaging the application. Currently, for example, it provides a <code>linux</code> target which will
make Go build the project for Linux architecture on any other Architecture i.e. cross-compiling.</p>

<p>It also provides an easy way to run unit tests with <code>make test</code> and installing with <code>make &amp;&amp; make install</code>.</p>

<p>That is all for Part 2. Join me in Part 3 where I will talk about the experimental Plugin system that Furnace employs.</p>

<h1 id="building-furnace-part-1">Building Furnace: Part 1</h1>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>This is the first part of a 4 part series which talks about the process of building a middlish sized project in Go,
with AWS. Including Unit testing and a experimental plugin feature.</p>

<p>The first part will talk about the AWS services used in brief and will contain a basic description for those who are not familiar
with them. The second part will talk about the Go SDK and the project structure itself, how it can be used, improved, and how it can
help in everyday life. The third part will talk about the experimental plugin system, and finally, we will tackle unit testing AWS
in Go.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s begin, shall we?</p>

<h1 id="aws">AWS</h1>

<h2 id="cloudformation">CloudFormation</h2>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t yet read about, or know off, AWS&rsquo; CloudFormation service, you can either go ahead and read the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">Documentation</a>
or read on for a very quick summary. If you are familiar with CF, you should skip ahead to <a href="##CodeDeploy">CodeDeploy</a> section.</p>

<p>CF is a service which bundles together other AWS services (for example: EC2, S3, ELB, ASG, RDS) into one, easily manageable stack.
After a stack has been created, all the resources can be handled as one, located, tagged and used via CF specific console commands.
It&rsquo;s also possible to define any number of parameters, so a stack can actually be very versatile. A parameter can be anything, from
SSH IP restriction to KeyPair names and list of tags to create or in what region the stack will be in.</p>

<p>To describe how these parts fit together, one must use a CloudFormation Template file which is either in JSON or in
YAML format. A simple example looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">    Parameters:
      KeyName:
        Description: The EC2 Key Pair to allow SSH access to the instance
        Type: AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName
    Resources:
      Ec2Instance:
        Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
        Properties:
          SecurityGroups:
          - Ref: InstanceSecurityGroup
          - MyExistingSecurityGroup
          KeyName:
            Ref: KeyName
          ImageId: ami-7a11e213
      InstanceSecurityGroup:
        Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
        Properties:
          GroupDescription: Enable SSH access via port 22
          SecurityGroupIngress:
          - IpProtocol: tcp
            FromPort: '22'
            ToPort: '22'
            CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
</code></pre>

<p>There are a myriad of these template samples <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/aws-cloudformation-templates/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not going to explain this in too much detail. Parameters define the parameters, and resources define all the AWS services which
we would like to configure. Here we can see, that we are creating an EC2 instance with a custom Security Group plus and already
existing security group. ImageId is the AMI which will be used for the EC2 instance. The InstanceSecurityGroup is only defining
some SSH access to the instance.</p>

<p>That is pretty much it. This can become bloated relatively quickly once, VPCs, ELBs, and ASGs come into play. And CloudFormation
templates can also contain simple logical switches, like, conditions, ref for variables, maps and other shenanigans.</p>

<p>For example consider this part in the above example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">      KeyName:
        Ref: KeyName
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we use the <code>KeyName</code> parameter as a Reference Value which will be interpolated to the real value, or the default one, as the
template gets processed.</p>

<h2 id="codedeploy">CodeDeploy</h2>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t heard about CodeDeploy yet, please browse the relevant <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/welcome.html">Documentation</a>
or follow along for a &ldquo;quick&rdquo; description.</p>

<p>CodeDeploy just does what the name says. It deploys code. Any kind of code, as long as the deployment process is described in a
file called <code>appspec.yml</code>. It can be easy as coping a file to a specific location or incredibly complex with builds of various
kinds.</p>

<p>For a simple example look at this configuration:</p>

<pre><code class="language-yaml">    version: 0.0
    os: linux
    files:
      - source: /index.html
        destination: /var/www/html/
      - source: /healthy.html
        destination: /var/www/html/
    hooks:
      BeforeInstall:
        - location: scripts/install_dependencies
          timeout: 300
          runas: root
        - location: scripts/clean_up
          timeout: 300
          runas: root
        - location: scripts/start_server
          timeout: 300
          runas: root
      ApplicationStop:
        - location: scripts/stop_server
          timeout: 300
          runas: root
</code></pre>

<p>CodeDeploy applications have hooks and life-cycle events which can be used to control the deployment process of an like, starting
the WebServer; making sure files are in the right location; copying files, running configuration management software like puppet,
ansible or chef; etc, etc.</p>

<p>What can be done in an <code>appspec.yml</code> file is described here: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/app-spec-ref.html">Appspec Reference Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Deployment happens in one of two ways:</p>

<h3 id="github">GitHub</h3>

<p>If the preferred way to deploy the application is from GitHub a commit hash must be used to identify which &ldquo;version&rdquo; of the
application is to be deployed. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">    rev = &amp;codedeploy.RevisionLocation{
        GitHubLocation: &amp;codedeploy.GitHubLocation{
            CommitId:   aws.String(&quot;kajdf94j0f9k309klksjdfkj&quot;),
            Repository: aws.String(&quot;Skarlso/furnace-codedeploy-app&quot;),
        },
        RevisionType: aws.String(&quot;GitHub&quot;),
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Commit Id is the hash of the latest release and repository is the full account/repository pointing to the application.</p>

<h3 id="s3">S3</h3>

<p>The second way is to use an S3 bucket. The bucket will contain an archived version of the application with a given extension. I&rsquo;m
saying given extension, because it has to be specified like this (and can be either &lsquo;zip&rsquo;, or &lsquo;tar&rsquo; or &lsquo;tgz&rsquo;):</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">    rev = &amp;codedeploy.RevisionLocation{
        S3Location: &amp;codedeploy.S3Location{
            Bucket:     aws.String(&quot;my_codedeploy_bucket&quot;),
            BundleType: aws.String(&quot;zip&quot;),
            Key:        aws.String(&quot;my_awesome_app&quot;),
            Version:    aws.String(&quot;VersionId&quot;),
        },
        RevisionType: aws.String(&quot;S3&quot;),
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we specify the bucket name, the extension, the name of the file and an optional version id, which can be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="deploying">Deploying</h3>

<p>So how does code deploy get either of the applications to our EC2 instances? It uses an agent which is running on all of the
instances that we create. In order to do this, the agent needs to be present on our instance. For linux this can be achieved with
the following UserData (UserData in CF is the equivalent of a bootsrap script):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">    &quot;UserData&quot; : {
        &quot;Fn::Base64&quot; : { &quot;Fn::Join&quot; : [ &quot;\n&quot;, [
            &quot;#!/bin/bash -v&quot;,
            &quot;sudo yum -y update&quot;,
            &quot;sudo yum -y install ruby wget&quot;,
            &quot;cd /home/ec2-user/&quot;,
            &quot;wget https://aws-codedeploy-eu-central-1.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install&quot;,
            &quot;chmod +x ./install&quot;,
            &quot;sudo ./install auto&quot;,
            &quot;sudo service codedeploy-agent start&quot;,
        ] ] }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>A simple user data configuration in the CloudFormation template will make sure that every instance that we create will have the
CodeDeploy agent running and waiting for instructions. This agent is self updating. Which can cause some trouble if AWS releases a
broken agent. However unlikely, it can happen. Never the less, once installed, it&rsquo;s no longer a concern to be bothered with.</p>

<p>It communications on HTTPS port 443.</p>

<p>CodeDeploy identifies instances which need to be updated according to our preferences, by tagging the EC2 and Auto Scaling groups.
Tagging happens in the CloudFormation template through the AutoScalingGroup settings like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">    &quot;Tags&quot; : [
        {
            &quot;Key&quot; : &quot;fu_stage&quot;,
            &quot;Value&quot; : { &quot;Ref&quot;: &quot;AWS::StackName&quot; },
            &quot;PropagateAtLaunch&quot; : true
        }
    ]
</code></pre>

<p>This will give the EC2 instance a tag called <code>fu_stage</code> with value equaling to the name of the stack. Once this is done, CodeDeploy
looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">    params := &amp;codedeploy.CreateDeploymentInput{
        ApplicationName:               aws.String(appName),
        IgnoreApplicationStopFailures: aws.Bool(true),
        DeploymentGroupName:           aws.String(appName + &quot;DeploymentGroup&quot;),
        Revision:                      revisionLocation(),
        TargetInstances: &amp;codedeploy.TargetInstances{
            AutoScalingGroups: []*string{
                aws.String(&quot;AutoScalingGroupPhysicalID&quot;),
            },
            TagFilters: []*codedeploy.EC2TagFilter{
                {
                    Key:   aws.String(&quot;fu_stage&quot;),
                    Type:  aws.String(&quot;KEY_AND_VALUE&quot;),
                    Value: aws.String(config.STACKNAME),
                },
            },
        },
        UpdateOutdatedInstancesOnly: aws.Bool(false),
    }
</code></pre>

<p>CreateDeploymentInput is the entire parameter list that is needed in order to identify instances to deploy code to. We can see
here that it looks for an AutoScalingGroup by Physical Id and the tag labeled <code>fu_stage</code>. Once found, it will use
<code>UpdateOutdatedInstancesOnly</code> to determine if an instance needs to be updated or not. Set to false means, it always updates.</p>

<h1 id="furnace">Furnace</h1>

<p>Where does <a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/go-furnace">Furnace</a> fit in, in all of this? Furnace provides a very easy mechanism to create,
delete and push code to a CloudFormation stack using CodeDeploy, and a couple of environment properties. Furnace <code>create</code> will
create a CloudFormation stack according to the provided template, all the while asking for the parameters defined in it for
flexibility. <code>delete</code> will remove the stack and all affiliated resources except for the created CodeDeploy application. For that,
there is <code>delete-application</code>. <code>status</code> will display information about the stack: Outputs, Parameters, Id, Name, and status.
Something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">    2017/03/16 21:14:37 Stack state is:  {
      Capabilities: [&quot;CAPABILITY_IAM&quot;],
      CreationTime: 2017-03-16 20:09:38.036 +0000 UTC,
      DisableRollback: false,
      Outputs: [{
          Description: &quot;URL of the website&quot;,
          OutputKey: &quot;URL&quot;,
          OutputValue: &quot;http://FurnaceSt-ElasticL-ID.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com&quot;
        }],
      Parameters: [
        {
          ParameterKey: &quot;KeyName&quot;,
          ParameterValue: &quot;UserKeyPair&quot;
        },
        {
          ParameterKey: &quot;SSHLocation&quot;,
          ParameterValue: &quot;0.0.0.0/0&quot;
        },
        {
          ParameterKey: &quot;CodeDeployBucket&quot;,
          ParameterValue: &quot;None&quot;
        },
        {
          ParameterKey: &quot;InstanceType&quot;,
          ParameterValue: &quot;t2.nano&quot;
        }
      ],
      StackId: &quot;arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-central-1:9999999999999:stack/FurnaceStack/asdfadsf-adsfa3-432d-a-fdasdf&quot;,
      StackName: &quot;FurnaceStack&quot;,
      StackStatus: &quot;CREATE_COMPLETE&quot;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>( This will later be improved to include created resources as well. )</p>

<p>Once the stack is <code>CREATE_COMPLETE</code> a simple <code>push</code> will deliver our application on each instance in the stack. We will get into
more detail about how these commands are working in Part 2 of this series.</p>

<h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1>

<p>This is it for now.</p>

<p>Join me next time when I will talk about the AWS Go SDK and its intricacies and we will start to look at the basics of Furnace.</p>

<p>As always,
Thanks for reading!

<p>CodeDeploy applications have hooks and life-cycle events which can be used to control the deployment process of an like, starting
the WebServer; making sure files are in the right location; copying files, running configuration management software like puppet,
ansible or chef; etc, etc.</p>

<p>What can be done in an <code>appspec.yml</code> file is described here: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codedeploy/latest/userguide/app-spec-ref.html">Appspec Reference Documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Deployment happens in one of two ways:</p>

<h3 id="github">GitHub</h3>

<p>If the preferred way to deploy the application is from GitHub a commit hash must be used to identify which &ldquo;version&rdquo; of the
application is to be deployed. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">    rev = &amp;codedeploy.RevisionLocation{
        GitHubLocation: &amp;codedeploy.GitHubLocation{
            CommitId:   aws.String(&quot;kajdf94j0f9k309klksjdfkj&quot;),
            Repository: aws.String(&quot;Skarlso/furnace-codedeploy-app&quot;),
        },
        RevisionType: aws.String(&quot;GitHub&quot;),
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Commit Id is the hash of the latest release and repository is the full account/repository pointing to the application.</p>

<h3 id="s3">S3</h3>

<p>The second way is to use an S3 bucket. The bucket will contain an archived version of the application with a given extension. I&rsquo;m
saying given extension, because it has to be specified like this (and can be either &lsquo;zip&rsquo;, or &lsquo;tar&rsquo; or &lsquo;tgz&rsquo;):</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">    rev = &amp;codedeploy.RevisionLocation{
        S3Location: &amp;codedeploy.S3Location{
            Bucket:     aws.String(&quot;my_codedeploy_bucket&quot;),
            BundleType: aws.String(&quot;zip&quot;),
            Key:        aws.String(&quot;my_awesome_app&quot;),
            Version:    aws.String(&quot;VersionId&quot;),
        },
        RevisionType: aws.String(&quot;S3&quot;),
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we specify the bucket name, the extension, the name of the file and an optional version id, which can be ignored.</p>

<h3 id="deploying">Deploying</h3>

<p>So how does code deploy get either of the applications to our EC2 instances? It uses an agent which is running on all of the
instances that we create. In order to do this, the agent needs to be present on our instance. For linux this can be achieved with
the following UserData (UserData in CF is the equivalent of a bootsrap script):</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">    &quot;UserData&quot; : {
        &quot;Fn::Base64&quot; : { &quot;Fn::Join&quot; : [ &quot;\n&quot;, [
            &quot;#!/bin/bash -v&quot;,
            &quot;sudo yum -y update&quot;,
            &quot;sudo yum -y install ruby wget&quot;,
            &quot;cd /home/ec2-user/&quot;,
            &quot;wget https://aws-codedeploy-eu-central-1.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install&quot;,
            &quot;chmod +x ./install&quot;,
            &quot;sudo ./install auto&quot;,
            &quot;sudo service codedeploy-agent start&quot;,
        ] ] }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>A simple user data configuration in the CloudFormation template will make sure that every instance that we create will have the
CodeDeploy agent running and waiting for instructions. This agent is self updating. Which can cause some trouble if AWS releases a
broken agent. However unlikely, it can happen. Never the less, once installed, it&rsquo;s no longer a concern to be bothered with.</p>

<p>It communications on HTTPS port 443.</p>

<p>CodeDeploy identifies instances which need to be updated according to our preferences, by tagging the EC2 and Auto Scaling groups.
Tagging happens in the CloudFormation template through the AutoScalingGroup settings like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-json">    &quot;Tags&quot; : [
        {
            &quot;Key&quot; : &quot;fu_stage&quot;,
            &quot;Value&quot; : { &quot;Ref&quot;: &quot;AWS::StackName&quot; },
            &quot;PropagateAtLaunch&quot; : true
        }
    ]
</code></pre>

<p>This will give the EC2 instance a tag called <code>fu_stage</code> with value equaling to the name of the stack. Once this is done, CodeDeploy
looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">    params := &amp;codedeploy.CreateDeploymentInput{
        ApplicationName:               aws.String(appName),
        IgnoreApplicationStopFailures: aws.Bool(true),
        DeploymentGroupName:           aws.String(appName + &quot;DeploymentGroup&quot;),
        Revision:                      revisionLocation(),
        TargetInstances: &amp;codedeploy.TargetInstances{
            AutoScalingGroups: []*string{
                aws.String(&quot;AutoScalingGroupPhysicalID&quot;),
            },
            TagFilters: []*codedeploy.EC2TagFilter{
                {
                    Key:   aws.String(&quot;fu_stage&quot;),
                    Type:  aws.String(&quot;KEY_AND_VALUE&quot;),
                    Value: aws.String(config.STACKNAME),
                },
            },
        },
        UpdateOutdatedInstancesOnly: aws.Bool(false),
    }
</code></pre>

<p>CreateDeploymentInput is the entire parameter list that is needed in order to identify instances to deploy code to. We can see
here that it looks for an AutoScalingGroup by Physical Id and the tag labeled <code>fu_stage</code>. Once found, it will use
<code>UpdateOutdatedInstancesOnly</code> to determine if an instance needs to be updated or not. Set to false means, it always updates.</p>

<h1 id="furnace">Furnace</h1>

<p>Where does <a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/go-furnace">Furnace</a> fit in, in all of this? Furnace provides a very easy mechanism to create,
delete and push code to a CloudFormation stack using CodeDeploy, and a couple of environment properties. Furnace <code>create</code> will
create a CloudFormation stack according to the provided template, all the while asking for the parameters defined in it for
flexibility. <code>delete</code> will remove the stack and all affiliated resources except for the created CodeDeploy application. For that,
there is <code>delete-application</code>. <code>status</code> will display information about the stack: Outputs, Parameters, Id, Name, and status.
Something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">    2017/03/16 21:14:37 Stack state is:  {
      Capabilities: [&quot;CAPABILITY_IAM&quot;],
      CreationTime: 2017-03-16 20:09:38.036 +0000 UTC,
      DisableRollback: false,
      Outputs: [{
          Description: &quot;URL of the website&quot;,
          OutputKey: &quot;URL&quot;,
          OutputValue: &quot;http://FurnaceSt-ElasticL-ID.eu-central-1.elb.amazonaws.com&quot;
        }],
      Parameters: [
        {
          ParameterKey: &quot;KeyName&quot;,
          ParameterValue: &quot;UserKeyPair&quot;
        },
        {
          ParameterKey: &quot;SSHLocation&quot;,
          ParameterValue: &quot;0.0.0.0/0&quot;
        },
        {
          ParameterKey: &quot;CodeDeployBucket&quot;,
          ParameterValue: &quot;None&quot;
        },
        {
          ParameterKey: &quot;InstanceType&quot;,
          ParameterValue: &quot;t2.nano&quot;
        }
      ],
      StackId: &quot;arn:aws:cloudformation:eu-central-1:9999999999999:stack/FurnaceStack/asdfadsf-adsfa3-432d-a-fdasdf&quot;,
      StackName: &quot;FurnaceStack&quot;,
      StackStatus: &quot;CREATE_COMPLETE&quot;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>( This will later be improved to include created resources as well. )</p>

<p>Once the stack is <code>CREATE_COMPLETE</code> a simple <code>push</code> will deliver our application on each instance in the stack. We will get into
more detail about how these commands are working in Part 2 of this series.</p>

<h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1>

<p>This is it for now.</p>

<p>Join me next time when I will talk about the AWS Go SDK and its intricacies and we will start to look at the basics of Furnace.</p>

<p>As always,
Thanks for reading!
Gergely.</p>
