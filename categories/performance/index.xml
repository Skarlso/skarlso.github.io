      <title>Doing CORS in Go with Gin and JSON</title>

      <description>Basics Hello folks.
This will be a quick post about how to do CORS with jQuery, Gin in Go with a very simple ajax GET and Json.
I&amp;rsquo;m choosing JSON here because basically I don&amp;rsquo;t really like JSONP. And actually, it&amp;rsquo;s not very complicated to do CORS, it&amp;rsquo;s just hidden enough so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t become transparent.
First, what is CORS? It&amp;rsquo;s Cross-Platform Resource Sharing. It has been invented so that without your explicit authorization in the header of a request, Javascript can&amp;rsquo;t reach outside of your domain and be potentially harmful to your visitors.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
I wanted to share with you my tale of working through the problems with Advent Of Code.
It is a nice tale and there are a few things I learned from it, especially in Go, since I used that solve all of the problems. So, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
Solving the problems The most important lesson I learned while doing these exercises was, how to solve these problems. A couple of them were simple enough to not have to over think it, but most of them got very tricky.</description>

      <description>Hello Folks.
Today I would like to share with you my little tale of refactoring my solution to Advent Of Code Day 13.
It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely tale of action, adventure, drama, and comedy.
Let&amp;rsquo;s being with my first iteration of the problem.
package main import ( &amp;#34;bufio&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;math&amp;#34; &amp;#34;os&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strconv&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; &amp;#34;github.com/skarlso/goutils/arrayutils&amp;#34; ) var seatingCombinations = make([][]string, 0) var table = make(map[string][]map[string]int) var keys = make([]string, 0) //Person a person type Person struct { // neighbour *Person 	name string like int } func main() { file, _ := os.</description>
