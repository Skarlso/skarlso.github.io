      <description>Intro One morning I woke up and tried to access my gitea just to find that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t running.

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
Today, I would like to show you how my infrastructure is deployed and managed. Spoiler alert, I&amp;rsquo;m using Kubernetes to do that.
I know&amp;hellip; What a twist!
Let&amp;rsquo;s get to it.
What What services am I running exactly? Here is a list I&amp;rsquo;m running at the time of this writing:

      <description>I had a lot of fun using Procreate to re-draw the architecture image I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn for my distribute face recognition application detailed in this post Distributed Face-Recognition App.
Without much fanfare, here is the drawing:
Thanks, Gergely.</description>

      <description>Intro Alright folks. Settle in and get comfortable. This is going to be a long, but hopefully, fun ride.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to deploy a distributed application with Kubernetes. I attempted to create an application that I thought resembled a real world app. Obviously I had to cut some corners due to time and energy constraints.
My focus will be on Kubernetes and deployment.
Shall we delve right in?
The Application TL;DR The application itself consists of six parts.</description>
