      <description>Update your CRDs with confidence Hello.
I would like to write about a release for crd-to-sample-yaml1. It&amp;rsquo;s the release version v0.8.02.
This version brings with it a feature to test the validity of your CRD changes.
It means that if you change your CRD it will test if the changes do not break working samples of that version.
This is achieved by a helm unittest type of YAML based test scenarios and snapshot generation.</description>

      <description>Self-Signed locally trusted certificates with cert-manager We are going to discuss how to set up a Kubernetes environment where components can run using HTTPS without pain.
Premise Usually, people either generate certificates outside the cluster using either openssl, or mkcert, then mount them in or use those as seeds for further generation. This poses a number of problems during testing and distribution of these certificates. And then, switching to production, it proves that local certs will either no longer work or pose even more problems in getting them properly distributed again.</description>

      <description>Hello dear reader.
I switched to a new theme that has Dark Mode. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping nothing changed regarding the RSS functionality.
I removed the comments because I rarely used them.
Also disabled any sort of tracking.
Enjoy, Gergely.</description>

      <description>Welcome dear reader.
When last we met, we talked a lot about setting up Tilt for rapid controller development.
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s see how powerful Tilt can be once we bring it together with Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; e2e-framework.
Controller E2E Framework I&amp;rsquo;d like to present my controller-e2e-framework which brings Tilt and e2e-framework together to easily write and run tests for controllers that work together.
This framework can be used to integration test or e2e test controllers that work together.</description>

      <description>Welcome dear reader.
Today, we are going to dive into how to use Tilt to speed up the feedback loop of developing a Kubernetes controller. We are going to do that using an open-source project called OCM which has a controller called ocm-controller. I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk through the following process:

      <title>How to deploy a Go (Golang) backend with a React frontend separately on Kubernetes - Part One</title>

      <description>Intro Welcome. This is a longer post about how to deploy a Go backend with a React frontend on Kubernetes as separate entities. Instead of the usual compiled together single binary Go application, we are going to separate the two. Why? Because usually a React frontend is just a &amp;ldquo;static&amp;rdquo; SPA app with very little requirements in terms of resources, while the Go backend does most of the leg work, requiring a lot more resources.</description>

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
This is a continuation of the previous post about my Kubernetes infrastructure located here. The two remaining points are to deploy Athens Go proxy and setting up monitoring.
Athens Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Athens.
First of all if you are a helm user, Athens has an awesome set of helm charts which you can use to deploy it in your cluster. Located here.
I prefer to deploy my own config files, but that&amp;rsquo;s me.</description>

      <description>Intro One morning I woke up and tried to access my gitea just to find that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t running.
I checked my cluster and found that the whole thing was dead as meat. I quickly jumped in and ran k get pods -A to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on. None of my services worked.
What immediately struck my eye was a 100+ pods of my fork_updater cronjob. The fork_updater cronjob which runs once a month, looks like this:</description>

      <description>I had a lot of fun using Procreate to re-draw the architecture image I&amp;rsquo;ve drawn for my distribute face recognition application detailed in this post Distributed Face-Recognition App.
Without much fanfare, here is the drawing:

      <description>Intro Alright folks. Settle in and get comfortable. This is going to be a long, but hopefully, fun ride.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to deploy a distributed application with Kubernetes. I attempted to create an application that I thought resembled a real world app. Obviously I had to cut some corners due to time and energy constraints.
My focus will be on Kubernetes and deployment.
Shall we delve right in?
The Application TL;DR The application itself consists of six parts.</description>
