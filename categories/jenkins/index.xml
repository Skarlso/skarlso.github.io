      <description>Hi folks.
I wanted to take the time to share with you a talk that I recently did.
The slides and the source I used, can be found here: Github.
And then, there is also a docker image which contains all the plugins, job configurations and all the practices which I did during the talk. Please feel free to have a go with it. DockerHub - Jenkins Best Practices.
For easy access and reading, here are the slides on Slideshare: Jenkins Best Practices Slides.</description>
