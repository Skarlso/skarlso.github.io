      <description>Intro Hi folks.
In the past couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly updating Furnace.
There are three major changes that happened. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at them, shall we?
Google Cloud Platform Furnace now supports Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides the same API to handle GCP resource as with AWS. Namely, create, delete, status, update. I opted to leave out push because Google mostly works with git based repositories, meaning a push is literary just a push, than Google handles distributing the new code by itself.</description>

      <description>Intro Hi All.
Today I would like to write about an AWS finger practice.
Previously, I wrote about how I build and deploy my blog with Wercker. Since, I&amp;rsquo;m a cloud engineer and I dislike Oracle and it&amp;rsquo;s ever expending tenctacles into the abyss, I wanted to switch to use something else.
My build and deploy cycle is simple.
Commit to Blogsource Repo -&amp;gt; Wercker WebHook -&amp;gt; Builds my blog using Hugo -&amp;gt; Pushed to a Different Repository which my Github Blog.</description>

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
Previously on this blog: Part 1. Part 2. Part 3.
In this part we are going to talk about Unit Testing Furnace and how to work some magic with AWS and Go.
Mock Stub Fake Dummy Canned  Unit testing in Go usually follows the Dependency Injection model of dealing with Mocks and Stubs.
## DI
Dependency Inject in short is one object supplying the dependencies of another object.</description>

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
Previously on this blog: Part 1. Part 2. Part 4.
In this part, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the experimental plugin system of Furnace.
Go Experimental Plugins Since Go 1.8 was released, an exciting and new feature was introduced called a Plug-in system. This system works with dynamic libraries built with a special switch to go build. These libraries, .so or .dylib (later), are than loaded and once that succeeds, specific functions can be called from them (symbol resolution).</description>

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
Previously on this blog: Part 1, Part 3, Part 4
In this part, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the AWS Go SDK and begin do dissect the intricacies of Furnace.
AWS SDK Fortunately, the Go SDK for AWS is quiet verbose and littered with examples of all sorts. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it less complex and less cryptic at times. I&amp;rsquo;m here to lift some of the early confusions, in hopes that I can help someone to avoid wasting time.</description>
