      <description>You can see, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to decide on a title. That&amp;rsquo;s because I wanted to express more than a &amp;ldquo;How to get started with Journaling&amp;rdquo; kind of vibe. There are a lot of posts about that already. Rather, this post depicts my struggle to get into this habit.
TL;DR
It turned out that it took way too long to get into writing a simple entry with too many steps. Taking out a notebook and starting to write is a lot faster and cheaper.</description>
