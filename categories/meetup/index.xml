      <description><![CDATA[<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>So I was at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/go-budapest">Go Budapest Meetup</a> yesterday, where the brilliant <a href="https://jbrandhorst.com/">Johan Brandhorst</a>
gave a talk about his project based on <a href="https://grpc.io/">gRPC</a> using <a href="https://github.com/improbable-eng/grpc-web">gRPC-web</a> +
<a href="https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs">GopherJS</a> + <a href="https://github.com/google/protobuf">protobuf</a>. He also has some Go
contributions and check out his project here: <a href="https://github.com/johanbrandhorst/protobuf">Protobuf</a>. It&rsquo;s GopherJS Bindings for
ProtobufJS and gRPC-Web.</p>
<p>It was interesting to see where these projects could lead and I see the potential in them. I liked the usage of Protobuf and gRPC,
I don&rsquo;t have THAT much experience with them. However after yesterday, I&rsquo;m eager to find an excuse to do something with these libraries.
I used gRPC indirectly, well, the result of it, when dealing with Google Cloud Platform&rsquo;s API. Which is largely generated code through
gRPC and protobuf.</p>
<p>He also presented a bi-directional stream communication between the gRPC-web client and the server which was an interesting feat
to produce. It did involve the use of <a href="https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sync/errgroup">errgroup</a>. Which is nice.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t look THAT much into WebAssembly however, again, after yesterday, I will. He gave a shout out to WebAssembly developers
that he is ready to tackle the Go bindings for WASM!</p>
<p>It was a good change of pace to look at some Go code being written, I&rsquo;ll be sure to visit the meetup again, in about three months
when the next one will come.</p>
<p>Maybe, I&rsquo;ll even give a talk if they are looking for speakers. ;)</p>
<p>A huge thank you to <a href="https://www.emarsys.com/en/about-us/">Emarsys Budapest</a> for organizing the event and bringing Johan to us
for his talk.</p>
<p>Thanks, <br>
Gergely</p>
