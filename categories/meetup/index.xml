      <description>Intro So I was at Go Budapest Meetup yesterday, where the brilliant Johan Brandhorst gave a talk about his project based on gRPC using gRPC-web + GopherJS + protobuf. He also has some Go contributions and check out his project here: Protobuf. It&amp;rsquo;s GopherJS Bindings for ProtobufJS and gRPC-Web.
It was interesting to see where these projects could lead and I see the potential in them. I liked the usage of Protobuf and gRPC, I don&amp;rsquo;t have THAT much experience with them.</description>
