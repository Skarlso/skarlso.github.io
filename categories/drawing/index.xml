      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to tell you about a little conversation I had with my friend Adrian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic was about how, when and what to log during a testing session regarding a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#8217;s see what came out of that talk&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
Today I want to write to you about learning something with a visual mind. There are a gazillion posts out there that tell you how to learn something with a visual mind. However, there are only a few actually describing how to learn something as complicated and logical as programming. How do you draw up a function? How do you draw up a cycle or a structure?
Actually these are really easy.</description>
