<p>Not a great many people know that I&#8217;m actually into Lock Picking as a hobby. This will not be a tutorial on how to do it, or I won&#8217;t really talk about how I do it; I would like to write about something completely different. So if you came here for that, here are a few very good resources:</p>

<p>For my post, click on&#8230;</p>

<p>So, why is lock picking like testing? I saw a great many posts which where trying to compare software testing to some activity. I even knew somebody who compared it to dancing. Because&#8230;? I don&#8217;t know, maybe he was trying out a talk material maybe? And he said &#8211; &#8220;I was in this club and watched a couple dance, and I was thinking, wow, this is like software testing.&#8221; &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t really react to that. But hey, kudos for out of the box thinking I guess.</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s see some of the similarities in picking and testing:</p>

<h4 id="thinking">Thinking</h4>

<p>It requires logical, critical thinking. It&#8217;s a puzzle that you have to solve. A puzzle which you basically solve by testing out solutions and see if they work. You can achieve this by trial and error, something testers face on a daily basis. After awhile you acquire something called finesse. Which will help you identify breaking points more easily. Since you have experience with a certain lock type, you already have a wast knowledge to rely on when you are trying to solve a new lock with the same build. You did your research you know its weaknesses hence you immediately have an attack vector on your hand.</p>

<h4 id="tools">Tools</h4>

<p>Lock picking has a wast number of tools. Each tool is design for a specific purpose. You can reuse tools but they are rarely a fit for other locks. Unless it&#8217;s a similar one. There are delicate tools and then there are brute force tools, which are very hard to use at first but after you get used to it and know how to handle it, it becomes massively helpful. You can build your own tools or use tools that are built for you by tool experts.</p>

<h4 id="solving-process">Solving Process</h4>

<p>When can you test an application to its fullest extend and capabilities? How can you achieve the most and best testing ever possible? You have to know how the application works. You have to know its components, its abilities, its capabilities and <strong>limits. </strong>For Lock Picking to be the best at what you do and to be able to move to a completely new lock and try to pick it, you have to know its flaws. You have to know when, and how it was built. You have to know what makes it tick, how it works, what it uses, how the inside mechanics look like in order to try to exploit them.</p>

<p>After you acquire this knowledge you will be able to build, or purchase a tool which will help you in solving the puzzle. But you were only able to do that because after you researched its manufacturing procedure you know that the last pin is hard to get to and that it has an anti drilling shield, so drilling is out of the question, and that it has a safety spring which locks the lock permanently upon tampering. If you would not be in the possession of this information you could have made a fatal error and could have made the client lost money ( since at that point they pretty much need to break down the door, unless the key is found again ( assuming the picking took place because the key was lost ) ).</p>

<h4 id="last-words">Last Words</h4>

<p>There you have it folks. That&#8217;s why Lock Picking is like software testing. Knowing structure, inside workings and the proper tools will help to achieve your goal. Just like in testing when you know your field, you know what to use, when, and how. <strong>Knowledge</strong> makes you the Best.</p>

<p>Good luck,</p>

<p>Happy Picking,</p>

Just like in testing when you know your field, you know what to use, when, and how. <strong>Knowledge</strong> makes you the Best.</p>

<p>Good luck,</p>

<p>Happy Picking,</p>

                        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s face the horrible truth:</p>

<p><strong>It&#8217;s rare / never happens that a manager / scrum master / product owner actually reads your cucumber test cases.</strong></p>

<p>Back in the old days, this was one of the selling points of human readable tests and DSLs. It sounds nice and I&#8217;m sure in a utopia it also works.</p>

<p>BDD is a very nice approach to write tests if used in a correct way. And I can relate that at some point, a manager or the product owner, actually writes up a draft of the tests. But that enthusiasm very rarely stays for the rest of the project.</p>

<p>Especially when you get to the point where your Cucumber test cases start to look something like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><span class="typ">Scenario</span><span class="pun">:</span> <span class="typ">User</span><span class="pln"> list
  </span><span class="typ">Given</span><span class="pln"> I post to </span><span class="str">"/users.json"</span> <span class="kwd">with</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln">
    </span><span class="str">"""
    {
      "</span><span class="pln">first_name</span><span class="str">": "</span><span class="typ">Steve</span><span class="str">",
      "</span><span class="pln">last_name</span><span class="str">": "</span><span class="typ">Richert</span><span class="str">"
    }
    """</span><span class="pln">
  </span><span class="typ">And</span><span class="pln"> I keep the JSON response at </span><span class="str">"id"</span> <span class="kwd">as</span> <span class="str">"USER_ID"</span><span class="pln">
  </span><span class="typ">When</span><span class="pln"> I </span><span class="kwd">get</span> <span class="str">"/users.json"</span><span class="pln">
  </span><span class="typ">Then</span><span class="pln"> the JSON response should have </span><span class="lit">1</span><span class="pln"> user
  </span><span class="typ">And</span><span class="pln"> the JSON response at </span><span class="str">"0"</span><span class="pln"> should be</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln">
    </span><span class="str">"""
    {
      "</span><span class="pln">id</span><span class="str">": %{USER_ID},
      "</span><span class="pln">first_name</span><span class="str">": "</span><span class="typ">Steve</span><span class="str">",
      "</span><span class="pln">last_name</span><span class="str">": "</span><span class="typ">Richert</span><span class="str">"
    }
    """</span></pre>

<p>If a product owner reads this, his reaction will be like: &#8220;What the hell is this? What&#8217;s users.json? Why is it there? Why should I even care? What&#8217;s a JSON response? Why should it match with the request? And what, if I keep the id at USER_ID? Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to get overwhelmed by things like this scenario when you start introducing actors into your tests and payloads to your public API. And suddenly you&#8217;ll end up with cucumber features which no other will be able to understand but the person who wrote it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little bit skeptic that it ever worked as intended. Sure, for a little while. But the dynamic nature of tests will surface soon enough. You can&#8217;t hide it forever.</p>

<p>The above example, if the payload and user would be hidden in a reusable code fragment behind the implementation, would look a bit more readable:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><span class="typ">Scenario</span><span class="pun">:</span> <span class="typ">User</span><span class="pln"> list
  </span><span class="typ">Given</span><span class="pln"> I post to user list</span> <span class="kwd">with data
</span><span class="pln">  | firstname | Steve |
  | lastname  | Richert |
</span><span class="pln">  </span><span class="typ">When</span><span class="pln"> I </span><span class="kwd">get</span> a response from the SUT<span class="pln">
  </span><span class="typ">Then</span><span class="pln"> the response should have the same user</span></pre>

<p>See? Easier to understand. I don&#8217;t care about the payload. I don&#8217;t care about the user ID, in fact, I would rather see this test as a unit test somewhere deep down in the bowls of the system. Although I can understand that you want a set of automated UATs.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure Cucumber has a couple of success stories behind his back, I just didn&#8217;t happen to come across them as of late. But please, if you have one, share it with me so I can rest easily.</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>Today, I would like to write about little observation I made along the way of being a tester.</p>

<p>The title says it all. I think Testers, are like scientists. I would go even further, and say: Testers, are scientists.</p>

<p>Let us see how the two compare.</p>

<h3 id="asking-questions">Asking Questions</h3>

<p>A scientist is all about asking the right question to the right person, or the right subject matter. They are using the same 5 Ws as we are. Who, Why, What, When, Where. It&#8217;s simple, really. Asking the right question is sometimes the most difficult task of them all. Ideas come from these questions. They can also help in flushing out early design problems with the experiment / product.</p>

<h4 id="identify-the-subject-matter">Identify the subject matter</h4>

<p>This one is all about getting to know your environment and taking notes while you are doing so. Become familiar with what you are working with, and what tools you are using in your research. Which standards are you following, and why? It&#8217;s the same, when a Tester finds herself/himself in a new environment and tries to get her(is) bearing what the task is and how to perform it.</p>

<h4 id="first-impression-outline-of-an-idea">First impression, outline of an idea</h4>

<p>The first impression will result in a vague idea of what the problem is about. This is the stage where the first thoughts emerge and the first draft of a possible solution is crafted into existence. This is the part where a person will draw information, power, and knowledge from her(is) past resulting in a solution that can get close to a real one; but rarely is this solution the one which will be chosen in the end.</p>

<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>

<p>Indeed in the life of a scientist it is imperative that ideas, solutions and vague drafts of brainstormed possibilities are <strong>tested all the way through. </strong>For a tester it&#8217;s just as important that all the cases are verified and &#8216;approved&#8217; by either common sense, the requirements, or any other kind of verification that they can come up in certain environments. Fact is, that if a solution / test case is a valid one, depends on several different options based on any given circumstance. That is why it&#8217;s difficult to decide if something is acceptable or not. What is a good solution in one case, might be entirely wrong in another.</p>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p>If the tests / variables / cases / solutions are satisfying, then we can come to think about producing an actual result. The result could be anything of value to the observer. A failing test could be a good result, if we actually were waiting for that test to fail. In that case the result is a success. So bare in mind that a failing test, a failed solution to an experiment, is <strong>always </strong>also information which <strong>tells you something important. </strong>Never dismiss a failing test, a failed experiment, a failed solution. It gives you a <strong>hint </strong>for a passing one.</p>

<h4 id="community-and-sharing">Community and Sharing</h4>

<p>Scientists have a large community where they are sharing experiments and discoveries. I think I don&#8217;t have to draw a parallel here. We all know several testing pages, forums, events, gatherings where there are people talking about the subject matter. I&#8217;m proud that it such a long way.</p>

<h4 id="practice-practice-practice">Practice, practice, practice</h4>

<p>I think this one is self explanatory. In order to become good at something, we have to continuously do it. There is no magic formula, no pill you can take, no matrix to download Kung Fu, you have to do it to learn it. You have to practice it, gather experience and share / write them down in order to strengthen your knowledge and understanding about it. Writing it out, and sharing information, <strong>explaining it to somebody else, </strong>will make it stick better and increase your knowledge in return. So start a blog now, even if you will have only a few readers it will be worth it. Just by writing a couple of lines about something will make you remember it better, and your understanding of it deeper.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. I think these are pretty good points that let&#8217;s us identify ourselves. It&#8217;s called Computer <strong>science</strong> for a reason.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>This time I&#8217;d like to write about the expressiveness of a Test. I think that it&#8217;s very important to write understandable and expressive tests. In older times I was studying novel writing. There is a rule which a novel needs to follow. It goes something like this: &#8220;A novel needs to lead its reader and make him understand in the simplest way what&#8217;s going on, with whom and why?&#8221;. In other words, it&#8217;s not a puzzle. It should be obvious what the test is trying to do and it should not require the reader to try and solve it in order to understand it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m planning this as a series since there are multiple problems with a test I can talk about here.</p>

<p><strong>Geb Tests</strong></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at homepages"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I entir my credential"</span>
            filloutLoginForm<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I can accass my wallet"</span>
            openWallet<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> <span style="color: #CC0099;">contains</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Balance"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now, read this test. It doesn&#8217;t really make any sense at the first read, right? You need to actually think what is going on there. Of course if you read it slow enough you&#8217;ll get what it&#8217;s trying to do. But you don&#8217;t know what fillform does. Apparently it also submits the form because after fillform you are suddenly at MyAccountPage.</p>

<p>There are several things wrong with this one, let&#8217;s start with the pageobject.</p>

<p><strong>PageObjects</strong></p>

<p>At and toAt return page objects. We can use that to actually make the calling explicit and make it more readable and identify where a function comes from.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at homepages"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I entir my credential"</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I can accass my wallet"</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> <span style="color: #CC0099;">contains</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Balance"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This reads much better now. You know where the function is coming from and your IDE will not go nuts from things it can&#8217;t find. And you have autocompletion so there is no fear that you simply mistype something.</p>

<p><strong>Side effects</strong></p>

<p>Next step, let&#8217;s remove some of the side effects.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at homepages"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I entir my credential"</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">submitLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I can accass my wallet"</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">accountIsDisplayed</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now this is again much better. There are no steps left out. And you can test now the FillForm and the submit independently. Like, submitting the form without filling it out! Or filling it out and not submiting it. Reads better, is explicit, more easy to understand.</p>

<p>And the last one for today:</p>

<p><strong>Grammar</strong></p>

<p>I wonder if you noticed it&#8230; The grammar is a little bit off in the tests. A small mistake here and there. You might think that, who cares? That&#8217;s a very bad thought. I think the correct grammar reflects caring. It reflects that we thought about this test and that we thought about the quality of it. Because it means that after you wrote it, you actually re-read the test to make sure it&#8217;s understandable and readable.</p>

<p>So let us correct that:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"As a player I can log in to check my account."</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at the homepage"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I enter my log in credentials."</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">submitLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I'm directed to my account page."</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">accountIsDisplayed</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>I also took the liberty of re-phrasing some of the text so that it shows what the test is about and what the user really would like to achieve here. Now try reading that last one. Does it make more sense? Did you understand it at first go? Did it read like a good story?</p>

<p>There is a coding practice which goes something like this: &#8220;Good code is code which doesn&#8217;t surprise you as you read it.&#8221; Which means the exact thing happens which you thought of would happen. I think that applies to tests as well. The steps of the test shouldn&#8217;t come to you as a surprise. Especially if you know what the application is supposed to do.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s all for today folks. Thank you for reading! If you have a nasty test which you would like me to dissect and make it better and human readable, please share it in the comment section and I will do my best to come up with a good solution for it.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p><strong>Geb Tests</strong></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">

        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>

<p>Now, read this test. It doesn&#8217;t really make any sense at the first read, right? You need to actually think what is going on there.

<p>Now this is again much better. There are no steps left out. And you can test now the FillForm and the submit independently. Like, submitting the form without filling it out! Or filling it out and not submiting it. Reads better, is explicit, more easy to understand.</p>

<p>And the last one for today:</p>

<p><strong>Grammar</strong></p>

<p>I wonder if you noticed it&#8230; The grammar is a little bit off in the tests. A small mistake here and there. You might think that, who cares? That&#8217;s a very bad thought. I think the correct grammar reflects caring. It reflects that we thought about this test and that we thought about the quality of it. Because it means that after you wrote it, you actually re-read the test to make sure it&#8217;s understandable and readable.</p>

<p>So let us correct that:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"As a player I can log in to check my account."</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at the homepage"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I enter my log in credentials."</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">submitLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I'm directed to my account page."</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">accountIsDisplayed</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>I also took the liberty of re-phrasing some of the text so that it shows what the test is about and what the user really would like to achieve here. Now try reading that last one. Does it make more sense? Did you understand it at first go? Did it read like a good story?</p>

<p>There is a coding practice which goes something like this: &#8220;Good code is code which doesn&#8217;t surprise you as you read it.&#8221; Which means the exact thing happens which you thought of would happen. I think that applies to tests as well. The steps of the test shouldn&#8217;t come to you as a surprise. Especially if you know what the application is supposed to do.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s all for today folks. Thank you for reading! If you have a nasty test which you would like me to dissect and make it better and human readable, please share it in the comment section and I will do my best to come up with a good solution for it.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>

                        <p>Hi Folks!</p>

<p>I just wanted to share with you my mind map on the seven principles of Context Driven Testing.</p>

<p>I used the notion of dragons since it&#8217;s seven. And a dragon is usually seven headed in my mind&#8230;</p>

<p>So without further ado&#8230;</p>

<p>Click for larger image.</p>

<p>I have a hand drawn as well but I&#8217;m guessing that one wouldn&#8217;t be of much use since it follows my own imagination.</p>

<p>Here are the seven principles in points which correspond to the leafs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Value -&gt; Practice -&gt; Depends -&gt; Context =&gt; The value of any practice depends on its context.</li>
<li>People -&gt; Working -&gt; Together -&gt; Important =&gt; People, working together, are the most important part of any project’s context. ( The mob, trying to kill the dragon by working together. )</li>
<li>Problem -&gt; Project -&gt; Solution =&gt; The product is a solution. If the problem isn’t solved, the product doesn’t work. ( The sword. It&#8217;s a sword but if it doesn&#8217;t kill the Dragon it&#8217;s useless. )</li>
<li>Good Testing -&gt; Intellectual Challenge =&gt; Good software testing is a challenging intellectual process. ( Well it&#8217;s a dragon with glasses. That&#8217;s something you rarely see. )</li>
<li>Good Practice | Bad Practice -&gt; In Context -&gt; No Best Practices =&gt; There are good practices in context, but there are no best practices. ( This one was a little bit tricky. But basically you want to solve the dungeon and not plow through it )</li>
<li>Uncertainty =&gt; <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;">Projects unfold over time in ways that are often not predictable. ( For me this one word was enough. )</span></li>
<li>Exercised By All In Time -&gt; Judgement | Skill | Cooperatively =&gt; Only through judgment and skill, exercised cooperatively throughout the entire project, are we able to do the right things at the right times to effectively test our products. ( It&#8217;s a flexing dragon&#8230; Easy, right? )</li>
</ol>

<p>So this map helped me to remember everything. The descriptions, applications that are further described I remembered by using this mind map as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci" target="_blank">loci</a>.</p>

<p>I hope somebody found this useful.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
