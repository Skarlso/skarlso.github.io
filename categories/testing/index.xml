      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not a great many people know that I&amp;#8217;m actually into Lock Picking as a hobby. This will not be a tutorial on how to do it, or I won&amp;#8217;t really talk about how I do it; I would like to write about something completely different. So if you came here for that, here are a few very good resources:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s face the horrible truth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s rare / never happens that a manager / scrum master / product owner actually reads your cucumber test cases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to write about little observation I made along the way of being a tester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title says it all. I think Testers, are like scientists. I would go even further, and say: Testers, are scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us see how the two compare.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why the expressiveness of your Tests is important – Part One</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I&amp;#8217;d like to write about the expressiveness of a Test. I think that it&amp;#8217;s very important to write understandable and expressive tests. In older times I was studying novel writing. There is a rule which a novel needs to follow. It goes something like this: &amp;#8220;A novel needs to lead its reader and make him understand in the simplest way what&amp;#8217;s going on, with whom and why?&amp;#8221;. In other words, it&amp;#8217;s not a puzzle. It should be obvious what the test is trying to do and it should not require the reader to try and solve it in order to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Folks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to share with you my mind map on the seven principles of Context Driven Testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used the notion of dragons since it&amp;#8217;s seven. And a dragon is usually seven headed in my mind&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So without further ado&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is TDD dead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really. So let&amp;#8217;s talk about this topic for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure you already read a gazillion posts about this debate but frankly I&amp;#8217;m writing this for myself, to rant a little bit, you know&amp;#8230; Because somebody is wrong on the internet and I must intervene.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to write about a very interesting topic, I hope. So let&amp;#8217;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the title already suggests, I&amp;#8217;m writing about why a front-end tester should learn at least a little bit about JavaScripting and the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohhh and contrary to the belief CSP ( Content Security Policy ) will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be the death of such scripts. There are white-lists and workarounds and exclusions which can be implemented in order to allow local JavaScripting to continue. So don&amp;#8217;t fret&amp;#8230; Read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic was about how, when and what to log during a testing session regarding a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to write a few words about Chrome&amp;#8217;s Search Engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re probably already using it for a couple of things, like Google, or Amazon searches or YouTube or anything like that. But are you using it to access environments and testing tools faster, with queries?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hello folks.
Today I would like to talk to you about something interesting I was talking about with a developer friend.
We talked about the quality of test code.
He said&amp;#8230; And I will quote this&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;Why should we care? It&amp;#8217;s not production code. We aren&amp;#8217;t giving it to the customer.&amp;#8221;
There are a few reasons why you are going to get a slap in the face for a sentence like this.</description>

      <description>Hey folks.
I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day.
If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It&amp;#8217;s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know&amp;#8230; It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.</description>

      <title>Cucumber Test Name and Tags on Feature</title>

      <description>Hello everybody.
I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.
Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm
You can try something like that:
  @After //this is cucumbers @Afters public static void afterExecution&amp;#40;Scenario scenario&amp;#41; &amp;#123; logger.log&amp;#40;&#34;The status of the test is: &#34; + scenario.getStatus&amp;#40;&amp;#41;&amp;#41;; &amp;#125;     But that isn&amp;#8217;t giving you too much now is it?</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today I&amp;#8217;d like to share with you some of the experiences I had as a beginner tester. I hope it sets you off on a path to enlightenment and leaves you off with a good appetite for testing. Shall we begin then?
The early days
It was 2004 when I finished school and started working at my first company. I finished as a software developer which is kind of an exaggeration since I only finished a 2 years course of it.</description>

      <description>Hello Everybody.
Today I would like to show you what you need to become a Testing expert.
If you had noticed I deliberately left out the word Software. Why? Because becoming and expert in Testing Anything has the same root as becoming an expert to test software. And for that let me take you back to a Galaxy Far Far Away in Time AND Space.
The beginnings&amp;#8230;
I went to school in Oroszlany, my home town in Hungary.</description>

      <title>TEAS: Testing Exploration Adventure Session</title>

      <description>Hello Everybody.
I&amp;#8217;d like to introduce T.E.A.S. to you. This is something I came up with yesterday which requires a lot of fantasy some good thinking planning and enthusiastic people. So, let&amp;#8217;s get started.
What is it about?
Testing Exploration Adventure Session is about&amp;#8230; Testing! There. No real surprise, eh? TEAS has it&amp;#8217;s roots in RPGs. Role Playing Games. If you ever heard or read about M.A.G.U.S. or the more known Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons you will have a better understanding of the concept behind this phenomena.</description>

      <title>JMS Connection setup and Framework</title>

      <description>Hello chumps.
Today I want to write about jms connection testing with a small framework. I wrote a small thing using a factory object model. It&amp;#8217;s a lead, a proof of concept. You can use this to go onward.
First, let&amp;#8217;s begin with the JMS connection it self.
JMS Connection
First rule of thumb is: &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t wait for a response when dealing with JMS queues.&amp;#8221; How so? Because, a JMS queue is asynchronous so you wont get back anything.</description>
