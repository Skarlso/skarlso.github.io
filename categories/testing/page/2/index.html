                        <p>Hey folks.</p>

<p>I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day.</p>

<p>If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It&#8217;s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know&#8230; It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.</p>

<p>Anyways&#8230;</p>

<p>Here is something to do when all of your test quit-&gt;</p>

    <span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>So there you go. You would need to call this in a @BeforeClass to have it attached. This is a small hook attached after each test has run which would submit a report built up from a file. Why not use a listener or a custom report generator or whatever? Because maybe you have the report done in a remote place where you need to place a csv file which will be available to everybody to look at. And you want the report to be sent and generated dynamically. Or you have some clean up to do after your suit is done.</p>

<p>In ruby the @AfterAll is actually equivalent to this which in ruby land would be at_exit.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="ruby" style="font-family:monospace;">  <span style="color:#CC0066; font-weight:bold;">at_exit</span> <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">do</span>
    <span style="color:#008000; font-style:italic;"># Global teardown</span>
    TempFileManager.<span style="color:#9900CC;">clean_up</span>
  <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">end</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>So there it is. Hope this helped.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p>G.</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.</p>

<p>Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm</p>

<p>You can try something like that:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">@After <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;">//this is cucumbers @Afters</span>
<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">static</span> <span style="color: #000066; font-weight: bold;">void</span> afterExecution<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>Scenario scenario<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
    logger.<span style="color: #006633;">log</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">"The status of the test is: "</span> <span style="color: #339933;">+</span> scenario.<span style="color: #006633;">getStatus</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
<span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>But that isn&#8217;t giving you too much now is it? And the API of scenario is as small as it can get. It offers you four options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>getStatus</li>
<li>isFailed</li>
<li>write</li>
</ul>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t help me. I wanted to get the name of the executed feature and the tags on that particular feature. I thought that&#8217;s got to be as easy as just getting a scenario accessing the feature and get the tags. Hooooowww boy I was wrong.</p>

<p>I ended up with this&#8230;.</p>

<p>Ohhhhh yes! The fields which I wanted were all private and not accessible. I&#8217;m sure there was a reason behind this decision but if it was sensible it eludes me. But in the world of programming nothing is impossible they say so there.</p>

<p>In cucumberFeature there will be everything what you need. Tags, Names, Tests, Execution time. Everything.</p>

<p>I know that cucumber runs with jUnit so if there is a better way to do this please for the love of my sanity share it with me.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;d like to share with you some of the experiences I had as a beginner tester. I hope it sets you off on a path to enlightenment and leaves you off with a good appetite for testing. Shall we begin then?</p>

<p><strong>The early days</strong></p>

<p>It was 2004 when I finished school and started working at my first company. I finished as a software developer which is kind of an exaggeration since I only finished a 2 years course of it. I wasn&#8217;t really one for school. I was more of a home learner. That&#8217;s how you learn programming these days anyways.</p>

<p>The company didn&#8217;t hire developers at that moment. At least not junior ones&#8230; But! They were kind enough to offer a position as a tester. As the saying goes, Don&#8217;t look a gift horse in the mouth, I accepted the position although my intention was to go over to development as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Years went by. I was still a tester. I foamed and fumed about it I wanted to be a dev guy. I was furious. I was angry. I was inpatient. I was an idiot. Instead of crying and instead of the light going on after 2-3 years or more I should have realised the potential of my position sooner.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation</strong></p>

<p>So there I was. I was sitting at my desk clicking away at stuff and writing up dull documentations about why I&#8217;m clicking at that stuff and how I&#8217;m clicking it. My document infect was so pretty and well formatted that I was fairly proud of it.</p>

<p>I ignored calls of my sanity and went on producing test cases and documents for many many more months / years. I was bad at my job. And I tell you why. I missed bugs I missed the little things that made the difference. I was following documentation by the letter I was leaving out things I wasn&#8217;t paying attention I wanted to be a developer damn it!</p>

<p>But fortunately because of various people in my life, like my brother, my resource manager, my friends and this guy :: James Marcus Bach ( <a href="http://www.satisfice.com/" title="http://www.satisfice.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.satisfice.com/">http://www.satisfice.com/</a></a> ) :: I soon begun to realise that this job is about so much more! I read Jame&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.buccaneerscholar.com/" title="The buccaneer scholar" target="_blank">The buccaneer scholar</a>.</p>

<p>It opened my eyes in so many ways. I knew that there is somebody else out there how is like me. Passionet and keen on learning new things. Exploring technology and going where nobody else went before. I was beginning to understand that I could be much more in this position. In my country at that time Testers weren&#8217;t regarded for too much. We were the enemy that needed defeating. We were in the way. We were somebody who had to be hated. Fortunately it changed much since then and lucky for us The Company had great support for Testers.</p>

<p>I learned that I can use my passion. I learned that testing can be / IS, indeed, the best thing that could have happened to me.</p>

<p><strong>Ascension</strong></p>

<p>With these new thoughts in my mind I begun to evolve. I realised that I can incorporate my dev skills into testing and later my testing skill into development. I was no longer following test cases blindly. I was no longer writing up pretty documentations ( I was writing other kind of documentations.. ðŸ˜‰ ). I was following instinct, skills, knowledge I hoarded from people. I was talking to the Devs, I was talking to the deployment team, I was talking to the managers AND the product owners. I hoarded knowledge as much as possible. I wrote everything down into my Mind Maps and was determined to become the single most knowledgable entity on the projects I was working on.</p>

<p>I created small tools that helped in my tedious, boring, unimaginative tasks of repetitive clicking. It didn&#8217;t took so long I was sharing my tools between other testers. Small javascripts which filled in forms. Tools, perl scripts to format docs and test results and so and so forth.</p>

<p>I embraced testing. It become my way of Life. It wasn&#8217;t a simple job anymore. It was embedded into my brain processes and synapses. And that&#8217;s when I got into automation.</p>

<p><strong>The later years</strong></p>

<p>So I got into automation. I loved it. The thought that I can bend the computers will to do my bidding / job was absolutely mind blowing. I&#8217;ve done development at that point already of course that wasn&#8217;t new to me. And I also was shown some way of automation but that wasn&#8217;t so great so I dismissed this possibility for a long time. After a while I came back to it with the thought that, hey I could do this better. Selenium came out at that time around, Watir was also there and a couple of other tools in Perl.</p>

<p>I started developing with / in / for those tools and noted that despite the believe that it&#8217;s only automation it actually took quite some thinking to come up with a framework that was adaptable, concise, manageable, fast and so on and so fort. It was an effort that most people didn&#8217;t realise or care to know about.</p>

<p>So for the better part of those years I was trying to convince people that building a testing framework requires actual development work. And is not something that should be taken lightly. I sort of succeeded with it&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Now</strong></p>

<p>After various circumstances in my life I moved to UK and took a job as an SET(Software Developer in Test). It sounds fancy but is rather just an automation guy who from time to time looks at production code. It was a spring board for me. And now days it seems I&#8217;m simply just a developer. But!!! And here comes the twist.</p>

<p>Because of my years of background in Test I feel I&#8217;m so much more. I know to write testable code. I know many ways how my code could fail. I know many ways of writing something and then coding up a script for testing or do extensive unit testing. I don&#8217;t love my code blindly so that when it&#8217;s done I only test the &#8220;happy path&#8221; because I don&#8217;t have the time to code up more.</p>

<p>I will always have time for testing. I will <strong>begin</strong> with testing. Because people need to understand that the only way to go fast is to go slow. If you go fast it will bite you in the behind and you will suffer more then you would have suffered if you would have written up that one last little test for that one last little corner for the world that is your boiling, brooding, breathing pile of code.</p>

<p><strong>The future</strong></p>

<p>Honestly I don&#8217;t know were I&#8217;m going from here. Being a full pledged developed is a new territory for me even though I was an automation dev before. But I&#8217;m looking forward to this exciting new life. And I will NEVER ditch my Testing carrier. In fact I&#8217;m aiming to complete the BBST course next month. Because once you&#8217;ve been a tester you will never go back being anything else. It becomes a part of you. And stays with you forever.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>Today I would like to show you what you need to become a Testing expert.</p>

<p>If you had noticed I deliberately left out the word Software. Why? Because becoming and expert in Testing Anything has the same root as becoming an expert to test software. And for that let me take you back to a Galaxy Far Far Away in Time AND Space.</p>

<p><strong>The beginnings&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>I went to school in Oroszlany, my home town in Hungary. My official Technical title would be Mechanical Testing Engineer. I had the luck that most things which were thought at that school and I liked were thought by people I liked too and were clever in their respective fields. Like Pneumatics, Metallurgy, Mechanics, Chemistry these were all really awesome fields. To this day I don&#8217;t know why I haven&#8217;t ended up in some lab testing the breaking point of metals and the capacity of various chemicals.</p>

<p>But ahh well.. I still remember some of the ISO standards we had to memorize. Like in Metallurgy the Charpy pendulum impact test which we loved so very much to perform. The ISO standard for that is ISO 148-1:2009. Now let me see if I still remember that correctly&#8230; Yes! I&#8217;ve still got it. So where am I going with this?</p>

<p><strong>Moving on&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Back then we performed a lot of operations on various metals and a lot of chemical testings and the like. The most important part of every performed test was always to have insight. Insight in the structure of the metal. How it was made, how it was moulded and then shaped and heated and cooled and so on and so forth. We had to know EVERYTHING about the creation of this element that we had to test. Without that knowledge you could of corse still perform the test but you didn&#8217;t had any additional information why that test was useful or what it proved. Sure, you could have looked at the specification of the metal but that didn&#8217;t give you anything about the inner structure of it.</p>

<p>That was provided to you by the knowledge of the procedure that created it.</p>

<p>You get where I&#8217;m going with this&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Insight</strong></p>

<p>So back to software testing&#8230; What is the single most important thing that gives you insight, that gives you the edge to be a professional? Knowing the development process. Knowing architecture. Knowing programming. Knowing the language and its capabilities and limitations.</p>

<p>Sure you can be a good manual Tester. Of course you can be an excellent Exploratory Tester. But look at the others. James Marcus Bach. Alan Richardson. Michael Bolton and I could go on&#8230; They all know programming. They all know it by heart and they could be exceptional programmers if they wanted to. They already know that in order to get very good at testing something you must have an insight on the subject matter. You can&#8217;t test it thoughtfully without knowing its limitations its rules that it obeys its exploits that you can use.</p>

<p><strong>Last words&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>So in order to excel at your craft of test you have to have insight of the subject of the test. You can still become good but you always have to aim high don&#8217;t you? A friend of mine reply to one of my tweets with a really good sentence:&#8221;&#8230;and then you realize that being the best in one implies being excellent in the other.&#8221;. Exactly. Because the two are interconnected. They aren&#8217;t actually two. It&#8217;s one. It&#8217;s called Engineering.</p>

<p>Have a nice day and as always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to introduce T.E.A.S. to you. This is something I came up with yesterday which requires a lot of fantasy some good thinking planning and enthusiastic people. So, let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<p><strong>What is it about?</strong></p>

<p>Testing Exploration Adventure Session is about&#8230; Testing! There. No real surprise, eh? TEAS has it&#8217;s roots in <strong>RPGs</strong>. Role Playing Games. If you ever heard or read about M.A.G.U.S. or the more known Dungeons &amp; Dragons you will have a better understanding of the concept behind this phenomena.</p>

<p><strong>Basics of RPG</strong></p>

<p>So now that we know that it has it&#8217;s rules in RPGs how will that be applied to testing and learning? Easy&#8230; Well it&#8217;s not that easy but after you grasp the concept it will get easy.</p>

<p>Just like in an RPG people get together first. There will be players in the group mostly and one or two Dungeon Masters. The task of the Dungeon Master is to facilitate the Game. The Game it self consists of a set of given rules and a World in which these rules are applied too. The Players are placed in this world which is created by the Dungeon Master. They are then given tasks that needs to be fulfilled in some particular way. That choice is of to the Players. The DM only facilitates. He is the Master of the given World. And plots against the players. He incorporates the Non Player Characters or NPCs of the World and tries hard to trifle the effort of the players.</p>

<p>This task can be anything from freeing a princes to twarthing a Magus from gaining Omnipotence or God like powers, to killing a Dragon for its treasures. And Players decide what to do and how to do it. The DM lists the options available. And as the Players move they get experience. They get stronger, faster, better, more intelligente.. They gain Levels.</p>

<p>Now&#8230; How does that fit into Testing?</p>

<p><strong>How does this fit into Testing?</strong></p>

<p>If you think about testing and the players what comes into mind? You have a product. And you have testers who explore this product in certain ways. As they go and find bugs ( kill mobs ) they get better and more efficient in finding other bugs based on the previous ones. Tasks get harder and harder as the most easy to find bugs are already taken care of. Elusive bugs will be harder to discover ( kill ).</p>

<p>And who is the Dungeon Master? I would say in this case it&#8217;s the Product Owner.</p>

<p><strong>How to begin</strong></p>

<p>So what now? You have your Testers ( Players ) and your Product Owner ( Dungeon Master ). What&#8217;s the next move? How does this all begin?</p>

<p>The PO present a software. He builds it. Finds it out. Puts together the pieces. Creates maps, road maps, site maps if it&#8217;s a server application then it&#8217;s structure maps and database diagrams and whatever helps him to present his product to the Testers. He slips and designs bugs into the system. Harder ones and also easier ones. He has to have a story in the application. Maybe it&#8217;s a web site that provides some service. There a lot of components that could go wrong.</p>

<p>The testers begin by asking questions&#8230; They begin as Level 1 Testers. They know nothing yet. They know no programming languages and no metrics and nothing. The goal is to have a fully covered product which they are confident enough to release. They can add the whole release process to the Game too. Depends on what the PO has in plan for that Session. Which could take a few hours or a whole day. Depends on the possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>How the Testing works and what&#8217;s a level?</strong></p>

<p>So as they go on and Test the product, which they have to do verbally, the PO knows what bugs they come across. As they find bugs they earn Experience points. The more they have the more they level up the more tools will be available to use. That can be given to chance. Throw a dice and select a tool from a pool of tools which are available to the whole Project.</p>

<p>You can have a Random factor to the bug finding process too. For example if a Tester tries to examine an area he throws a dice to determine his ability to find bugs. That ability comes from initial stats that can be defined at the begin of the game. If he succeeds he finds a bug and gets points for it. The tools can increase the ability to find bugs. For example automation can add bonus to finding repetitive bugs but can add minus points to fantasy / finding really nasty elusive bugs because you might concentrate less on details.</p>

<p>So a Level defines the Testers ability to find bugs. The higher level he gets the better his abilities will be to find bugs.</p>

<p>The PO defines the End Game. The Games goal could be to find x number of bugs. Or to release the product. Or to bash it, crack it, hack it destroy it. It could be that you have to sell it or demo it to some stack holders. The possibilities are Legion.</p>

<p><strong>How to go on&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>I know that this is all very confusing yet.. I&#8217;m still working out the individual rules, plays and numbers and Character sheets and such. Any thoughts and ideas are appreciated.</p>

<p>The merits of this game are many. It practices testing it practices the ability to explore a product only in fantasy. It helps who ever designs a product to get a glimpse into the world of designing.</p>

<p>Also the product might even be not from this time!! It can be a future product of some holographic nature! Or an Audio Visual interface that&#8217;s hooked into the users Brain. Or some other advanced future technology. How would you Test that???? How would you test a robot arm controlling algorithm. Or an Artificial Intelligence that controls tactical missiles overseas.</p>

<p>The possibilities are virtually limitless. It&#8217;s up to the Product Owners fantasy what he builds. It could be a whole new virtual World like the Holoroom in Star Trek. How would you Test THAT???</p>

<p>If you are interested in this endevour follow me for more details.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

                        <p>Hello chumps.</p>

<p>Today I want to write about jms connection testing with a small framework. I wrote a small thing using a factory object model. It&#8217;s a lead, a proof of concept. You can use this to go onward.</p>

<p>First, let&#8217;s begin with the JMS connection it self.</p>

<p><strong>JMS Connection</strong></p>

<p>First rule of thumb is: &#8220;Don&#8217;t wait for a response when dealing with JMS queues.&#8221; How so? Because, a JMS queue is asynchronous so you wont get back anything. There are however two ways of checking if it was a success or not.</p>

<p>1: Check your database. The service you are trying out probably records something in the database, right? Check it&#8230; You can use a simple JDBC connection, or a Postgres connection or whatever your choice of database is.</p>

<p>2: You can monitor use the log of your choice of service provider. If there is an exception the moment you send something, you can be sure it is received. Just the format is not correct. This is of course based on how your service handles exceptions.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s get down to business.</p>

<p>First, there is a really good article on how to create a JMS connection.</p>

<p>This is the link for it: <a href="http://www.javablogging.com/simple-guide-to-java-message-service-jms-using-activemq" title="Simple JMS How To">Simple Guide to Java message service JMS using ActiveMQ</a></p>

<p>Itt will tell you everything you need to know about creating a connection and waiting for a response.</p>

<p>I will tell you now how to use this information in a real live environment.</p>

<p>In a real environment you will be using a queue which has certain settings that will not allow you to &#8220;join&#8221; it, or creating it. And you need to get the name of the queue and certain settings, like the destination URL.</p>

<p>First, the tool you are going to use is called JConsole. JConsole is a tool to monitor applications. It&#8217;s tool to monitor the JVM. I wont go into details about it since there are numerous descriptions about it. It is part of the java installation.</p>

<p>So after firing it up and giving it a connection url which would look like this: &#8216;service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://hostName:portNum/jmxrmi&#8217;, you would go ahead and search on the TAB:<strong>Threads</strong>.</p>

<p>Look for a Thread that is labelled like this: <YourConnectionLayer> Transport Server: tcp://0.0.0.0: <port></p>

<p>This will be your destination url.</p>

<p>In the blog the guy is using ActiveMQ. It&#8217;s your best guess. It&#8217;s lightweight, it&#8217;s fast it&#8217;s easy. Go for it.</p>

<p>So your Destination would look like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
2
3
4
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">    ConnectionFactory connectionFactory <span style="color: #339933;">=</span>
            <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">new</span> ActiveMQConnectionFactory<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">"&lt;yourserviceparameter&gt;://tcp://0.0.0.0:&lt;port&gt;"</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
    <span style="color: #003399;">Connection</span> connection <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> connectionFactory.<span style="color: #006633;">createConnection</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
    connection.<span style="color: #006633;">start</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>After that you will need the queue name which you can get as easy as this. Go to the TAB <strong>MBeans</strong>. There you can see, if you are using ActiveMQ, you will see something like this : org.active.activemq. Open this up and you will see under localhost a number of queues that your server has configured. Open up one of them and copy the queue name in the createQueue.</p>

<p>Use it like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">    Destination destination <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> session.<span style="color: #006633;">createQueue</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">"&lt;queue name&gt;"</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Of course if your service is configured properly you wont have any access to it. Use the connection like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">    connection <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> connectionFactory.<span style="color: #006633;">createConnection</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #0000ff;">"password"</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>You will have now logged in with the proper user.</p>

<p>Now you can send the message. You have everything configured.</p>

<p><strong>Framework</strong></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s speak about the framework you will need to properly use this technology.</p>

<p>One of the paradigms for programming is design to interfaces. If you need a proper working framework, your ave to design with the mind set to changing pieces of code. Thinking about what would change the most. Your connection settings. You want a framework which can use any kind of connection. Not just JMS but whatever connection you would like. It could be a synchronous one. Or a database one. Or a JMS. Doesn&#8217;t matter. You are only interested in a message sent or a connection, or whatever you want.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s get to it.</p>

<p>Interface:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
2
3
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">interface</span> IConnection <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
    <span style="color: #000066; font-weight: bold;">void</span> sendMessage<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
    <span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This is sample connection interface. You could have numerous templates here.</p>

<p>You will be using an object factory pattern here. Your implementer will be taken for a Java Property file. But it can be taken from whatever configuration you like. XML maybe, or a database even.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see you connection factory:</p>

<p>Easy enough, right? Class.forname will instantiate the class name you have in the property file. This could be something like this: com.packagename.ClassName. Doesn&#8217;t matter to you. You can add some typeof checks, or instanceof checks, whatever you like. Or you can use <Type> generics.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s get to the concrete implementation:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">class</span> JMSConnectionImpl <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">implements</span> IConnection <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
    Logger logger <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">new</span> Logger<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>

    <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
&nbsp;
    <span style="color: #003399;">Connection</span> connection <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> <span style="color: #000066; font-weight: bold;">null</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
        .
        .
        .
        <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">finally</span>
        <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
            connection.<span style="color: #006633;">close</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
        <span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span>
&nbsp;
    <span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span>
<span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Simple enough. Here you have a concrete implementation of your collection and your sender class.</p>

<p>And the simple usage facility of this is&#8230; simple too:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
2
3
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">    IConnection iConnection <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> ConnFactory.<span style="color: #006633;">getImplementer</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
&nbsp;
    iConnection.<span style="color: #006633;">sendMessage</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Simple enough too, right? So what happens here? You have a factory that will give you back any kind of implementation you are writing in you property file. You don&#8217;t care what the implementation is in your test. You don&#8217;t care what it&#8217;s name is. You don&#8217;t care what it&#8217;s result is. Okay, you care about the result, but that&#8217;s another history since you will check that elsewhere.</p>

<p>There you go. If any question occurs, please don&#8217;t hesitate to ask.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
