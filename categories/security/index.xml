      <description>Hi folks.
Following a long search and reading lots of debates and possibilities of doing SSH within Go, I was shocked to see that not a great many tools and people use SSH with host key verification. What I usually see is this:
HostKeyCallback: ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey()  This is terrible. Now, I realise that doing HostKeyVerification can be tedious, but don&amp;rsquo;t fear. It&amp;rsquo;s actually easy now that the Go team provided the knownhosts subpackage in their crypto SSH package located here: KnownHosts.</description>
