      <description>Hello Dear readers.
Today&amp;rsquo;s reader&amp;rsquo;s digest comes with a repo and some code too! Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.
Reader&amp;rsquo;s Digest - January Immune Immune is an absolutely fabulous book. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing and in time of this pandemic a healthy read to boot. I love biology, but never went too deep into it. This book fascinated me with its colorful images, the style of Kurzgesagt story telling and the man himself, who is the voice of Kurzgesagt.</description>

      <description>Hello Dear readers.
Today, I would like to write about a project design pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve been using successfully over the past years for various projects. It has many variations and it has some design patterns that are commonly found in the wild, so there is nothing really special about it.
Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.
Providers Pattern What is this pattern anyways? It&amp;rsquo;s a pattern I learned while working at ArangoDB. It&amp;rsquo;s quite nice and defines package abstractions wonderfully.</description>

      <description>Prologue Hello all.
This is a summary of the book Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Brain. Let me begin by saying the book is fantastic and you should definitely read it. The research put into it is phenomenal, and the many linked notes, data and reference make for an amazing and compelling read!
Not to mention that it is fantastic that someone put actual effort and data into finding out how programmers operate, think and behave.</description>

      <description>Reader&amp;rsquo;s Digest I thought it would a cool idea if I kept a summary of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve read or listened to on a monthly basis. Here is July of 2021 so far. Enjoy.
Ultimate Go This book is a culmination of Bill Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s Ultimate Go course and notes which were spawned from them by Hoanh An. Bill Kennedy set out to put everything together and create a notebook which can be read and followed like the personal notes of a student.</description>

Hell Divers 6: Allegiance I love the Hell Divers series. I listened to this one on audible as always and it was fantastic, as always. King Xavier Rodriguez. That sounds as bad ass as it is. We follow King Xavier and Rhino, his trusted subordinate into battle with a new threat called Skin Walkers and of course the machines, the defectors which are trying to kill everyone.</description>

Invincible After seeing it air on Amazon Prime, I had to go and read the comic. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot, but I assure you it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. Some spoiler alerts&amp;hellip;
Okay, so we follow this guy, Mark Grayson.</description>

The Aurora Database paper The paper about Aurora database from AWS can be found here: Paper. It details the design decision taken to support a highly available, fault tolerant, fast replicating database. They take the following approach&amp;hellip; They modified mysql database such as that they only send around the redo log and the redo log is enough to recover / replicate in order to achieve write and read consistency.</description>

All systems red - Murderbot This book is SHORT. It&amp;rsquo;s little over 3 hours of listening time. I&amp;rsquo;m listening at 1.30 so it&amp;rsquo;s just short of 2 hours. But it&amp;rsquo;s entertaining. The murderbot series is following a rouge security bot which hacked its own governor module and is self aware and free.</description>
