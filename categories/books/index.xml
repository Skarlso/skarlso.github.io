      <description>Reader&amp;rsquo;s Digest I thought it would a cool idea if I kept a summary of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve read or listened to on a monthly basis. Here is April of 2021 so far. Enjoy.
Invincible After seeing it air on Amazon Prime, I had to go and read the comic. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot, but I assure you it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. Some spoiler alerts&amp;hellip;
Okay, so we follow this guy, Mark Grayson.</description>

It details the design decision taken to support a highly available, fault tolerant, fast replicating database. They take the following approach&amp;hellip; They modified mysql database such as that they only send around the redo log and the redo log is enough to recover / replicate in order to achieve write and read consistency.</description>

All systems red - Murderbot This book is SHORT. It&amp;rsquo;s little over 3 hours of listening time. I&amp;rsquo;m listening at 1.30 so it&amp;rsquo;s just short of 2 hours. But it&amp;rsquo;s entertaining. The murderbot series is following a rouge security bot which hacked its own governor module and is self aware and free.</description>
