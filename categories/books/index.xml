      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Dear readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s reader&amp;rsquo;s digest comes with a repo and some code too! Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;readers-digest---january&#34;&gt;Reader&amp;rsquo;s Digest - January&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;immune&#34;&gt;Immune&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Immune-Journey-Mysterious-System-Keeps/dp/0593241312&#34;&gt;Immune&lt;/a&gt; is an absolutely fabulous book. It&amp;rsquo;s amazing
and in time of this pandemic a healthy read to boot. I love biology, but never went too deep into it. This book fascinated
me with its colorful images, the style of Kurzgesagt story telling and the man himself, who is the voice of Kurzgesagt.
I&amp;rsquo;ve read it all with his voice in my head.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Providers Pattern</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2021/12/21/providers-pattern/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 01:01:00 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://skarlso.github.io/2021/12/21/providers-pattern/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Dear readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to write about a project design pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve been using successfully over the past years for
various projects. It has many variations and it has some design patterns that are commonly found in the wild, so there
is nothing really special about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;providers-pattern&#34;&gt;Providers Pattern&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this pattern anyways? It&amp;rsquo;s a pattern I learned while working at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.arangodb.com/&#34;&gt;ArangoDB&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s
quite nice and defines package abstractions wonderfully. It somewhat resembles the Repository pattern from DDD and also
uses Chain of Responsibility to setup multiple providers for a given functionality. Like a fallback, in case a Provider
does not understand the current thing it got. In that case, it will delegate to &lt;code&gt;Next&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Summary of Programmer&#39;s Brain</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;prologue&#34;&gt;Prologue&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hello all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a summary of the book &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain&#34;&gt;Programmer&amp;rsquo;s Brain&lt;/a&gt;. Let me begin by saying the book is fantastic and you should definitely read it. The research put into it is phenomenal, and the many linked notes, data and reference make for an amazing and compelling read!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not to mention that it is fantastic that someone put actual effort and data into finding out how programmers operate, think and behave. And most of all, how our code behaves and reading, and dealing with code is not just about understanding algorithms and finding the best possible and most optimized code ever.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;readers-digest&#34;&gt;Reader&amp;rsquo;s Digest&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it would a cool idea if I kept a summary of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve read or listened to on a monthly
basis. Here is July of 2021 so far. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ultimate-go&#34;&gt;Ultimate Go&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Go-Notebook-William-Kennedy/dp/1737384426/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3EYE58E3G0EO3&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=go+ultimate+notebook&amp;qid=1630309494&amp;sprefix=go+ultimate+%2Caps%2C244&amp;sr=8-3&#34;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; book is a culmination of Bill Kennedy&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ultimate-go-programming/9780135261651/&#34;&gt;Ultimate Go course&lt;/a&gt; and notes
which were spawned from them by &lt;a href=&#34;https://hoanhan.co/&#34;&gt;Hoanh An&lt;/a&gt;. Bill Kennedy set out to put everything together and create
a notebook which can be read and followed like the personal notes of a student.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Reader&#39;s Digest 2021-06</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2021/06/30/readers-digest/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;readers-digest&#34;&gt;Reader&amp;rsquo;s Digest&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it would a cool idea if I kept a summary of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve read or listened to on a monthly
basis. Here is June of 2021 so far. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;hell-divers-6-allegiance&#34;&gt;Hell Divers 6: Allegiance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love the Hell Divers series. I listened to this one on audible as always and it was fantastic, as always.
King Xavier Rodriguez. That sounds as bad ass as it is. We follow King Xavier and Rhino, his trusted subordinate into
battle with a new threat called Skin Walkers and of course the machines, the defectors which are trying to kill everyone.
Also, there is now a signal from a possible group of people who are surviving on the surface for more than 200 years!
Xavier hates being king but does anything to keep the peace and humanity alive. Sadly, not all of his people agree to that
especially not after what they did to their people. The people of the metal island, the cannibals are harsh people. And
they don&amp;rsquo;t get along nicely all the time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;readers-digest&#34;&gt;Reader&amp;rsquo;s Digest&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought it would a cool idea if I kept a summary of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve read or listened to on a monthly
basis. Here is April of 2021 so far. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;invincible&#34;&gt;Invincible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After seeing it air on Amazon Prime, I had to go and read the comic. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot, but I assure you it&amp;rsquo;s worth it.
Some spoiler alerts&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, so we follow this guy, Mark Grayson. He&amp;rsquo;s Invincible. He is also and alien, called a Viltrumite. I can hardly
summaries over 3000 pages of comic books so I&amp;rsquo;ll try to be brief.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I thought it would a cool idea if I kept a summary of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve read or listened to on a monthly
basis. Here is March of 2021 so far. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-aurora-database-paper&#34;&gt;The Aurora Database paper&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper about Aurora database from AWS can be found here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://nil.csail.mit.edu/6.824/2020/papers/aurora.pdf&#34;&gt;Paper&lt;/a&gt;.
It details the design decision taken to support a highly available, fault tolerant, fast replicating
database. They take the following approach&amp;hellip; They modified mysql database such as that they only send
around the redo log and the redo log is enough to recover / replicate in order to achieve write and
read consistency. They separate the data into Protected Groups and speed up terabytes of recovery by
doing 10 Gigabyte segments in parallel. The database IS the logs. By only replicating the log instead
of the data and the data page, they save millions in networks costs. The main gain however, is that
the storage was modified to understand the application. Instead of using General store they use a storage
which understand the data. In this case, decoupling storage from the database, as so many do, was actually
a drawback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;all-systems-red---murderbot&#34;&gt;All systems red - Murderbot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is SHORT. It&amp;rsquo;s little over 3 hours of listening time. I&amp;rsquo;m listening at 1.30 so it&amp;rsquo;s just short of 2 hours.
But it&amp;rsquo;s entertaining. The murderbot series is following a rouge security bot which hacked its own governor module
and is self aware and free. But&amp;hellip; it kind of hates humans and interacting with them. It just calls itself murderbot
but has no intention of killing all humans. Instead, all its wants to do is basically&amp;hellip; watch movies and various series on something called a Feed. In the first book of the series, this one, we follow Murderbot protect a few humans
that it gets to short of like after an attempt on their lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
