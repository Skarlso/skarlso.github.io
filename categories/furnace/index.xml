      <description>Hi.
A quick update, but a very important and interesting one hopefully. Furnace just got a massive boost to its plugin system.
I&amp;rsquo;m using HashiCorp&amp;rsquo;s Go-Plugins system now to handle plugins. This means one of two things that are interesting to the plugin author.
One, plugins can be written in any language which is supported by Furnace and supports GRPC. Currently this means that plugins can be written in the following languages:</description>

      <title>Huge Furnace Update</title>

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
In the past couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly updating Furnace.
There are three major changes that happened. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at them, shall we?
Google Cloud Platform Furnace now supports Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides the same API to handle GCP resource as with AWS. Namely, create, delete, status, update. I opted to leave out push because Google mostly works with git based repositories, meaning a push is literary just a push, than Google handles distributing the new code by itself.</description>
