      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, Dear Reader!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settle in for a long one this time. I would like to write about my journey from being a Tester back in 2004 to being
a software engineer today ( 2024 ). A mere 20 year long journey. I&amp;rsquo;m going to write down how I got this far, what it
took, the sacrifices, fears, doubts and all the things in between. Let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-early-days&#34;&gt;The early days&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 2002, I became a student for a two year long certificate study for a position called Software Programmer.
It was a paid course. My mother paid for the two years, it was the cheapest options at that time in Hungary.
The school, SZAMALK, was 80km from where I lived, so I had to travel everyday. The bus ride took about 1.5 hours that I
mostly managed to sleep through. Then school until 2pm-ish and then travel back home. Another 1.5 hours. I woke up at
5AM to get to school on time. It was quite rough. I mostly slept through my classes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
