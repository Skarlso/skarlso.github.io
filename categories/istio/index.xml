      <description>How to contribute to a new repository Hello Dear readers.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through a process of contributing into a new repository. If you are new to Go development and would like to contribute somewhere but are at a loss in large repositories, this post will be for you.
I selected the top repository in trending Go today. Which is istio. I think that&amp;rsquo;s sufficiently large and I have no idea about the repository, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through my process.</description>
