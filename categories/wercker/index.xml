      <description>Hi Folks.
So Wercker was not working. After a minor modification it seems to be okay now. The config file needed for it to work looks like this:
box: golang build: steps: - arjen/hugo-build: theme: redlounge deploy: steps: - install-packages: packages: git - leipert/git-push: gh_oauth: $GIT_TOKEN repo: skarlso/skarlso.github.io branch: master basedir: public The modification is the box type to golang and removed ssh-client from packages.
Thanks, Gergely.</description>

      <description>There already is a nice tutorial on how to create github-pages with Hugo Here if you prefer deplying your pages to a different branch on the same repo. There is also a post about Wercker and Hugo Here deploying pages to said separate branch.
However, I took an easier approach on the matter with a completely separate branch for my blog source and my compiled github pages.
