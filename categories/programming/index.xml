      <title>Doing CORS in Go with Gin and JSON</title>

      <description>Basics Hello folks.
This will be a quick post about how to do CORS with jQuery, Gin in Go with a very simple ajax GET and Json.
I&amp;rsquo;m choosing JSON here because basically I don&amp;rsquo;t really like JSONP. And actually, it&amp;rsquo;s not very complicated to do CORS, it&amp;rsquo;s just hidden enough so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t become transparent.
First, what is CORS? It&amp;rsquo;s Cross-Platform Resource Sharing. It has been invented so that without your explicit authorization in the header of a request, Javascript can&amp;rsquo;t reach outside of your domain and be potentially harmful to your visitors.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
I wanted to share with you my tale of working through the problems with Advent Of Code.
It is a nice tale and there are a few things I learned from it, especially in Go, since I used that solve all of the problems. So, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
Solving the problems The most important lesson I learned while doing these exercises was, how to solve these problems. A couple of them were simple enough to not have to over think it, but most of them got very tricky.</description>

      <description>Hello Folks.
Today I would like to share with you my little tale of refactoring my solution to Advent Of Code Day 13.
It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely tale of action, adventure, drama, and comedy.
Let&amp;rsquo;s being with my first iteration of the problem.

      <description>Hi folks and a Happy new Year!
Today, I would like to show you some interesting things you can do with channels. Consider the following simple example.
package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func main() { generatedPassword := make(chan int, 100) correctPassword := make(chan int) defer close(generatedPassword) defer close(correctPassword) go passwordIncrement(generatedPassword) go checkPassword(generatedPassword, correctPassword) pass := &amp;lt;-correctPassword fmt.Println(pass) } func checkPassword(input &amp;lt;-chan int, output chan&amp;lt;- int) { for { p := &amp;lt;-input //Introduce lengthy operation here 	// time.</description>

      <description>Hello Folks.
This is just a quick post on the topic and a reminder for myself and everybody to ALWAYS USE []BYTE INSTEAD OF STRINGS.
[]Byte is marginally faster than a simple Strings. In fact, I would say using []byte should be the standard instead of strings.
Sample code:
package solutions import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; const ( //INPUT input  INPUT = &amp;#34;1321131112&amp;#34; //LIMIT limit  LIMIT = 50 ) //LookAndSay translates numbers according to Look and Say algo func LookAndSay(s string, c chan string) { charCount := 1 look := &amp;#34;&amp;#34; for i := range s { if i+1 &amp;lt; len(s) { if s[i] == s[i+1] { charCount++ } else { look += fmt.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody!
I wanted to do a sort post about word frequency count. I did it many times now and I was curious as how a recursive solution would perform as opposed to looping.
So I wrote it up quickly and added a few benchmarks with different sized data.
First&amp;hellip;. The code:
var freqMap = make(map[string]int, 0) func countLettersRecursive(s string) string { if len(s) == 0 { return s } freqMap[string(s[0])]++ return countLettersRecursive(s[1:]) } func countLettersLoop(s string) { for _, v := range s { freqMap[string(v)]++ } } Very simple.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Here is a little something I&amp;rsquo;ve put together, since I&amp;rsquo;m doing it a lot.
Go Development Environment
If I have a project I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute, like GoHugo, I have to setup a development environment, because most of the times, I&amp;rsquo;m on a Mac. And on OSX things work differently. I like to work in a Linux environment since that&amp;rsquo;s what most of the projects are built on.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
So, I was playing around and created a client for JIRA written in Go. It was nice to do some JSON transformation. And sending POSTS was really trivial.
It’s still in it’s infancy and I have a couple of more features I want to implement, but, here is the code…
It can also be found under my github page: GoJira Github.
Feel free to open up issues if you would like to use it and need some features which you would find interesting.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today, I present to you the One Hundred Day Github Challenge.
The rules are simple:
 Minimum of One commit every day for a Hundred days. Commit has to be meaningful but can be as little as a fix in a Readme.md. Doesn’t matter if you are on vacation, there are no exceptions. There. Are. No. Exceptions. If you fail a day, you have to start over. No cheating.</description>

I started to build a Progress Quest type of web app in Go.
If you’d like to join, or just tag along, please drop by here =&amp;gt; Go Progress Questand feel free to submit an issue if you have an idea, or would like to contribute!
I will try and document the Progress…
Thank you for reading!

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud of this one too. No peaking. I like how go let&amp;rsquo;s you do this kind of stuff in a very nice way.
package circular import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; //TestVersion testVersion const TestVersion = 1 //Buffer buffer type type Buffer struct { buffer []byte full int size int s, e int } //NewBuffer creates a new Buffer func NewBuffer(size int) *Buffer { return &amp;amp;Buffer{buffer: make([]byte, size), s: 0, e: 0, size: size, full: 0} } //ReadByte reads a byte from b Buffer func (b *Buffer) ReadByte() (byte, error) { if b.</description>

      <description>Hi Folks.
Ever used Job DSL pluginfor Jenkins? What is that you say? Well, it’s TEH most awesome plug-in for Jenkins to have, because you can CODE your job configuration and put it under source control.
Today, however, I’m not going to write about that because the tutorials on Jenkins JOB DSL are very extensive and very well done. Anyone can pick them up.
Today, I would like to write about a part of it which is even more interesting.</description>

Next time, I want better abstractions. And a way to select columns based on their header data. For now, this is not bad.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
A small update to this. I created the model now, which is the database design for this app. It’s very simple, nothing fancy. Also, I’m writing the app with Python 3 from now on.
Here is the model now:
Worth noting a few things here. The __str__ is only with Python 3. In Python 2 it would be unicode. And the OneToOne and the foreign key are automatically using Primary keys defined in the references model.</description>
