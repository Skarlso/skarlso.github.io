      <title>Doing CORS in Go with Gin and JSON</title>

      <description>Basics Hello folks.
This will be a quick post about how to do CORS with jQuery, Gin in Go with a very simple ajax GET and Json.
I&amp;rsquo;m choosing JSON here because basically I don&amp;rsquo;t really like JSONP. And actually, it&amp;rsquo;s not very complicated to do CORS, it&amp;rsquo;s just hidden enough so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t become transparent.
First, what is CORS? It&amp;rsquo;s Cross-Platform Resource Sharing. It has been invented so that without your explicit authorization in the header of a request, Javascript can&amp;rsquo;t reach outside of your domain and be potentially harmful to your visitors.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
I wanted to share with you my tale of working through the problems with Advent Of Code.
It is a nice tale and there are a few things I learned from it, especially in Go, since I used that solve all of the problems. So, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
Solving the problems The most important lesson I learned while doing these exercises was, how to solve these problems. A couple of them were simple enough to not have to over think it, but most of them got very tricky.</description>

      <description>Hello Folks.
Today I would like to share with you my little tale of refactoring my solution to Advent Of Code Day 13.
It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely tale of action, adventure, drama, and comedy.
Let&amp;rsquo;s being with my first iteration of the problem.

      <description>Hi folks and a Happy new Year!
Today, I would like to show you some interesting things you can do with channels. Consider the following simple example.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34  package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func main() { generatedPassword := make(chan int, 100) correctPassword := make(chan int) defer close(generatedPassword) defer close(correctPassword) go passwordIncrement(generatedPassword) go checkPassword(generatedPassword, correctPassword) pass := &amp;lt;-correctPassword fmt.</description>

      <title>Use Byte Array Instead of Strings</title>

      <description>Hello Folks.
This is just a quick post on the topic and a reminder for myself and everybody to ALWAYS USE []BYTE INSTEAD OF STRINGS.
[]Byte is marginally faster than a simple Strings. In fact, I would say using []byte should be the standard instead of strings.
Sample code:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43  package solutions import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; const ( //INPUT input  INPUT = &amp;#34;1321131112&amp;#34; //LIMIT limit  LIMIT = 50 ) //LookAndSay translates numbers according to Look and Say algo func LookAndSay(s string, c chan string) { charCount := 1 look := &amp;#34;&amp;#34; for i := range s { if i+1 &amp;lt; len(s) { if s[i] == s[i+1] { charCount++ } else { look += fmt.</description>

      <title>Recursive Letter Frequency Count</title>

      <description>Hello everybody!
I wanted to do a sort post about word frequency count. I did it many times now and I was curious as how a recursive solution would perform as opposed to looping.
So I wrote it up quickly and added a few benchmarks with different sized data.
First&amp;hellip;. The code:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  var freqMap = make(map[string]int, 0) func countLettersRecursive(s string) string { if len(s) == 0 { return s } freqMap[string(s[0])]++ return countLettersRecursive(s[1:]) } func countLettersLoop(s string) { for _, v := range s { freqMap[string(v)]++ } }   Very simple.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Here is a little something I&amp;rsquo;ve put together, since I&amp;rsquo;m doing it a lot.
Go Development Environment
If I have a project I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute, like GoHugo, I have to setup a development environment, because most of the times, I&amp;rsquo;m on a Mac. And on OSX things work differently. I like to work in a Linux environment since that&amp;rsquo;s what most of the projects are built on.</description>
