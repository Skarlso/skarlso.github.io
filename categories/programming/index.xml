      <title>Doing CORS in Go with Gin and JSON</title>

      <description>Basics Hello folks.
This will be a quick post about how to do CORS with jQuery, Gin in Go with a very simple ajax GET and Json.
I&amp;rsquo;m choosing JSON here because basically I don&amp;rsquo;t really like JSONP. And actually, it&amp;rsquo;s not very complicated to do CORS, it&amp;rsquo;s just hidden enough so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t become transparent.
First, what is CORS? It&amp;rsquo;s Cross-Platform Resource Sharing. It has been invented so that without your explicit authorization in the header of a request, Javascript can&amp;rsquo;t reach outside of your domain and be potentially harmful to your visitors.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
I wanted to share with you my tale of working through the problems with Advent Of Code.
It is a nice tale and there are a few things I learned from it, especially in Go, since I used that solve all of the problems. So, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
Solving the problems The most important lesson I learned while doing these exercises was, how to solve these problems. A couple of them were simple enough to not have to over think it, but most of them got very tricky.</description>

      <description>Hello Folks.
Today I would like to share with you my little tale of refactoring my solution to Advent Of Code Day 13.
It&amp;rsquo;s a lovely tale of action, adventure, drama, and comedy.
Let&amp;rsquo;s being with my first iteration of the problem.

      <description>Hi folks and a Happy new Year!
Today, I would like to show you some interesting things you can do with channels. Consider the following simple example.
package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func main() { generatedPassword := make(chan int, 100) correctPassword := make(chan int) defer close(generatedPassword) defer close(correctPassword) go passwordIncrement(generatedPassword) go checkPassword(generatedPassword, correctPassword) pass := &amp;lt;-correctPassword fmt.Println(pass) } func checkPassword(input &amp;lt;-chan int, output chan&amp;lt;- int) { for { p := &amp;lt;-input //Introduce lengthy operation here // time.</description>

      <description>Hello Folks.
This is just a quick post on the topic and a reminder for myself and everybody to ALWAYS USE []BYTE INSTEAD OF STRINGS.
[]Byte is marginally faster than a simple Strings. In fact, I would say using []byte should be the standard instead of strings.
Sample code:
package solutions import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; const ( //INPUT input INPUT = &amp;#34;1321131112&amp;#34; //LIMIT limit LIMIT = 50 ) //LookAndSay translates numbers according to Look and Say algo func LookAndSay(s string, c chan string) { charCount := 1 look := &amp;#34;&amp;#34; for i := range s { if i+1 &amp;lt; len(s) { if s[i] == s[i+1] { charCount++ } else { look += fmt.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody!
I wanted to do a sort post about word frequency count. I did it many times now and I was curious as how a recursive solution would perform as opposed to looping.
So I wrote it up quickly and added a few benchmarks with different sized data.
First&amp;hellip;. The code:
var freqMap = make(map[string]int, 0) func countLettersRecursive(s string) string { if len(s) == 0 { return s } freqMap[string(s[0])]++ return countLettersRecursive(s[1:]) } func countLettersLoop(s string) { for _, v := range s { freqMap[string(v)]++ } } Very simple.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Here is a little something I&amp;rsquo;ve put together, since I&amp;rsquo;m doing it a lot.
Go Development Environment
If I have a project I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute, like GoHugo, I have to setup a development environment, because most of the times, I&amp;rsquo;m on a Mac. And on OSX things work differently. I like to work in a Linux environment since that&amp;rsquo;s what most of the projects are built on.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
So, I was playing around and created a client for JIRA written in Go. It was nice to do some JSON transformation. And sending POSTS was really trivial.
It&amp;rsquo;s still in it&amp;rsquo;s infancy and I have a couple of more features I want to implement, but, here is the code.
package main import ( &amp;#34;bytes&amp;#34; &amp;#34;encoding/json&amp;#34; &amp;#34;flag&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;io/ioutil&amp;#34; &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; &amp;#34;net/http&amp;#34; &amp;#34;os&amp;#34; &amp;#34;github.com/BurntSushi/toml&amp;#34; ) var configFile = &amp;#34;~/.jira_config.toml&amp;#34; var parameter string var flags struct { Comment string Description string IssueKey string Priority string Resolution string Title string Project string } //Issue is a representation of a Jira Issue type Issue struct { Fields struct { Project struct { Key string `json:&amp;#34;key&amp;#34;` } `json:&amp;#34;project&amp;#34;` Summary string `json:&amp;#34;summary&amp;#34;` Description string `json:&amp;#34;description&amp;#34;` Issuetype struct { Name string `json:&amp;#34;name&amp;#34;` } `json:&amp;#34;issuetype&amp;#34;` Priority struct { ID string `json:&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;` } `json:&amp;#34;priority&amp;#34;` } `json:&amp;#34;fields&amp;#34;` } //Transition defines a transition json object.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today, I present to you the One Hundred Day Github Challenge.
The rules are simple:
Minimum of One commit every day for a Hundred days. Commit has to be meaningful but can be as little as a fix in a Readme.md. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you are on vacation, there are no exceptions. There. Are. No. Exceptions. If you fail a day, you have to start over. No cheating. You only cheat yourself, so this is really up to you.</description>

I started to build a Progress Quest type of web app in Go.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to join, or just tag along, please drop by here =&amp;gt; Go Progress Quest and feel free to submit an issue if you have an idea, or would like to contribute!
I will try and document the Progress.
Thank you for reading!

      <description>Hi Folks.
Ever used Job DSL plugin for Jenkins? What is that you say? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s TEH most awesome plug-in for Jenkins to have, because you can CODE your job configuration and put it under source control.
Today, however, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to write about that because the tutorials on Jenkins JOB DSL are very extensive and very well done. Anyone can pick them up.
Today, I would like to write about a part of it which is even more interesting.</description>

A small update to this. I created the model now, which is the database design for this app. It&amp;rsquo;s very simple, nothing fancy. Also, I&amp;rsquo;m writing the app with Python 3 from now on.
Here is the model now:
from django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User # Create your models here. class Item(models.Model): name = models.CharField(max_length=100, default=&amp;#34;Item&amp;#34;) damage = models.IntegerField(default=) defense = models.IntegerField(default=) consumable = models.BooleanField(default=False) def __str__(self): return self.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
Just a small script which calculates your distance from a lever focal point if you know your weight, the object&amp;rsquo;s weight and the object&amp;rsquo;s and the distance the object has from the focal point of the lever.
Like this:
This script will give you D1. And this is how it will look like in doing so:
So, in order for me (77kg) to lift an object of 80kg which is on a, by default, 1 meter long lever, I have to stand back ~1.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about plans. It&amp;rsquo;s good to have one. For example, I have a plan for this year.
I kind of like math. So, I have this book:
It&amp;rsquo;s 1400 pages long and basically, has everything in it. It&amp;rsquo;s a rather exhaustive book. Hence, my plan is to finish the book by the end of 2015 and write a couple of python scripts that calculate something interesting.
(2021 Hindsight): Yeah, I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage this&amp;hellip; But it&amp;rsquo;s a cool idea, let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can get around coming further.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today I would like to take you on a journey I fought myself through in order to write a python android app, which gets you a random problem from Sphere Judge Online. Then you can mark it as solved and it will be stored as such, and you can move on to the next problem. With the words of Neil deGrasse Tyson, Come with Me!
Beginnings When I first embarked on this endeavour I ran into numerous errors, many amongst them being compilation issues when I was trying to install libraries.</description>

&lt;p&gt;This time I would like to bring it to a bit of overdrive. See, how re-factoring works on a larger scale model with multiple pages. And how it can organize assets, such as, images, multiple CSS, some plugins, you know, ordinary web stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi,
This time I would like to write about something that interests me. I wanted to try out a pure JavaScript web framework.
My choice is: Meteor. Looks interesting enough and it was recommended by a friend of mine. So, let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.
Installation As always, one starts with installation. The page tells us to follow this simple step:
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh Easy enough, when you are on Linux. Turns out, that there is no official release yet for Windows.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I&amp;rsquo;d like to write about the expressiveness of a Test. I think that it&amp;rsquo;s very important to write understandable and expressive tests. In older times I was studying novel writing. There is a rule which a novel needs to follow. It goes something like this: &amp;ldquo;A novel needs to lead its reader and make him understand in the simplest way what&amp;rsquo;s going on, with whom and why?&amp;rdquo;. In other words, it&amp;rsquo;s not a puzzle. It should be obvious what the test is trying to do and it should not require the reader to try and solve it in order to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to write a little bit about a python course I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an 8 week course on algorithmic programming with fun little projects. I&amp;rsquo;d like to write down some of my solutions with pseudo code for my own better understanding and for the sake of sharing knowledge. I won&amp;rsquo;t, however, share full projects since that would be against the honour code.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So last I was writing about why a tester should learn Javascript. Today I would like to write about why a tester should learn SQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, I said it. I know many people, especially testers, don&amp;rsquo;t like SQL. They view it as a monster best be avoided. Something only Database people will know. Something which is so scary and ugly, nobody really wants it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I will give you a couple of good reasons why you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be afraid of SQL. And why you should welcome it as your best friend and partner in crime.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to write about a very interesting topic, I hope. So let&amp;rsquo;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the title already suggests, I&amp;rsquo;m writing about why a front-end tester should learn at least a little bit about JavaScripting and the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohhh and contrary to the belief CSP ( Content Security Policy ) will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be the death of such scripts. There are white-lists and workarounds and exclusions which can be implemented in order to allow local JavaScripting to continue. So don&amp;rsquo;t fret. Read on.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Today I would like to write a few words about Chrome&amp;rsquo;s Search Engines.
You&amp;rsquo;re probably already using it for a couple of things, like Google, or Amazon searches or YouTube or anything like that. But are you using it to access environments and testing tools faster, with queries?
For example, here is a quick Jira Search made easy:
Keyword: jira
URL: https://atlas.projectname.com/jira/browse/PROJECT-%s
So just type: jira|space|9999

      <description>Hello guys.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to share a little something with you. It&amp;rsquo;s what I cooked up in Python to check an unknown number of content items in a web application.
Basically the script runs from a script folder under Grails. It goes through all the configured folders where there is static content like images, javascript, css and so on and so forth.
And then with curl it calls these items up in using their respective paths&amp;rsquo;.</description>

Today I would like to talk to you about something interesting I was talking about with a developer friend.
We talked about the quality of test code.
He said. And I will quote this.&amp;ldquo;Why should we care? It&amp;rsquo;s not production code. We aren&amp;rsquo;t giving it to the customer.&amp;rdquo;
There are a few reasons why you are going to get a slap in the face for a sentence like this.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody.
I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.
Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm
You can try something like that:
@After //this is cucumbers @Afters public static void afterExecution(Scenario scenario) { logger.log(&amp;#34;The status of the test is: &amp;#34; + scenario.getStatus()); } But that isn&amp;rsquo;t giving you too much now is it? And the API of scenario is as small as it can get.</description>

Today I want to write about a little trick I learned.
If you are working with legacy code and you don&amp;rsquo;t have the chance to eliminate core design problems, you can use this little pattern to help you out.
Problem
Problem is that you have a class that has a gazillion collaborators and at some point in time one of the clever devs thought it would be a cool idea to do dependancy injection via the constructor.</description>

It is not the best solution but this is my first try. I did it with TDD so there were tests first, which I&amp;rsquo;m not going to copy in..
public class WrapKata { public String wrap(String input, int columnSize) { if (input.length() &amp;lt;= columnSize) return input; else { return wrapLines(input, columnSize); } } private String wrapLines(String input, int columnSize) { int breakPoint = getBreakPoint(input, columnSize); String head = createHead(input, breakPoint); String tail = createTail(input, breakPoint); return head += &amp;#34;\n&amp;#34; + wrap(tail, columnSize); } private String createTail(String input, int breakPoint) { return input.</description>

      <description>Hi.
Today I want to talk about a common problem in many frameworks I encountered over the course of my carrier as a Java dev / automation engineer, whatnot.
Throwing Exceptions. That is in your method you have something like this:
public void insertMethodNameHere(String param) throws Exception {} This is bad. And I will tell you in short forms why.
Hides exceptions
This one should be obvious. When a method throws exception you can never be sure what kind of exceptions it handles.</description>

Is it Comments?
No. It&amp;rsquo;s not comments. If your code could be read properly you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t need comments to explain what it does. Like Uncle Bob said. A good code doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain surprises.</description>

      <description>Hello chumps.
Today I want to write about jms connection testing with a small framework. I wrote a small thing using a factory object model. It&amp;rsquo;s a lead, a proof of concept. You can use this to go onward.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s begin with the JMS connection it self.
JMS Connection
First rule of thumb is: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t wait for a response when dealing with JMS queues.&amp;rdquo; How so? Because, a JMS queue is asynchronous so you wont get back anything.</description>

      <description>When I see something like this:
public class Config { public static final string DATABASELINK = &amp;#34;linkhere&amp;#34;; . . . } It sends a small, but chilling shiver down my spine. Just. don&amp;rsquo;t. There are a lot of possibilities to use configuration in Java. Java property files. Xml. Xml serialization. CSV file. Whatever suits you best, but this? DON&amp;rsquo;T!</description>

      <description>Hello.
This is just a quick post to test the working of the code tag.
Given(/The Action is ([A-z]*)/) do |action| @action = action end Perfect!!
The name of the plugin is WP-Syntax. The trick is to edit the page in plain HTML. Because the WordPress word editor screws up the &amp;lt;&amp;gt; tags. But surely you already knew that.</description>
