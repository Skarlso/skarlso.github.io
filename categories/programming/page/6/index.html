                        <p>Hello guys.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to share a little something with you. It&#8217;s what I cooked up in Python to check an unknown number of content items in a web application.</p>

<p>Basically the script runs from a script folder under Grails. It goes through all the configured folders where there is static content like images, javascript, css and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>And then with curl it calls these items up in using their respective paths&#8217;. This works best on localhost if you have your local environment configured to access these elements because in some places direct access is restricted.</p>

<p>This script only check static content. Dynamically generated content would have to be hard coded to check.</p>

<p>It only generated a file currently with ERROR on a not match an success on match and not found if it encounters an item which it doesn&#8217;t know about.</p>

<p>So without further ado&#8230; The Script:</p>

                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>Today I would like to talk to you about something interesting I was talking about with a developer friend.</p>

<p>We talked about the quality of test code.</p>

<p>He said&#8230; And I will quote this&#8230;&#8221;Why should we care? It&#8217;s not production code. We aren&#8217;t giving it to the customer.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why you are going to get a slap in the face for a sentence like this. And let&#8217;s clarify here that we are talking about unit and functional tests as well. It shouldn&#8217;t matter what tests you are thinking about.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #1</strong></p>

<p>If a new comer comes to the company ( and don&#8217;t tell me that&#8217;s not happening so frequently ) then there are a few very good ways how he can learn to work with the new system. The first and almost best way to do so is&#8230; to look at the tests. Because the tests are representing your system. And how will it look like if the tests are in a bad shape? What will his or her thoughts be?</p>

<p>a. Wow what nice people what nice code. This looks fantastic. I&#8217;m sure they are a bunch of people who care very much about code and practices and the quality of the product.</p>

<p>b. Wow this is amazing. I&#8217;m sure I will learn a lot about good coding practices here and I will have fun with a bunch of very clever people.</p>

<p>c. Wow what the hell is this piece of cr*p? How the hell did I end up here? What are these people? A bunch of neanderthals? What does this even do? Where did it come from and why?</p>

<p>I think we can agree on what his thoughts will be. And on top of that he will have a very hard time learning the code and what it does.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #2</strong></p>

<p>Another reason is because you think that you write it down once and then you can forget about it&#8230; Well guess again. That&#8217;s not how things work in the software development word. You WILL have to go back to it eventually and then you will curse all hell for begin such an idiot about it not to factor out that one method that would have made your life, and everybody elses, a bit easier.</p>

<p>Even after a week or two you won&#8217;t remember how and why you wrote what you wrote and then you will be in a whole new world of hurt. You will have a very hard time finiding out the things you did and then trying to backtrack your steps to a place where you have some recollections.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #3</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s like grammar. You think it doesn&#8217;t matter that you misspelled a word or two in an error message. Or that you have a bad name for a method or a really really critical grammatical error in a catch sentence? You think it doesn&#8217;t matter since it&#8217;s not affecting the logic of your code? Well think again. You are right in that it doesn&#8217;t affect the logic of your code ( as long as you constantly make the same grammatical error in a sentence ) but it will affect how YOU personally look like.</p>

<p>It will affect your profession. The way people think and talk about you. They won&#8217;t think that you are a professional even though your logic is solid. They will think that you are sloppy and careless. And the same goes for the quality of your tests.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #4</strong></p>

<p>Quality can determine the solidness of the logic in the test. If your quality is bad you might actually test the bad thing. Your test might actually not do what you think since you can&#8217;t even figure it out. Your test might be doing something entirely different and you wouldn&#8217;t even notice.</p>

<p>And a fautly test leaves you with a false positive and a potential very serious bug on your hand which you thought you had covered.</p>

<p><strong>Final Slap ( I mean thought )</strong></p>

<p>So&#8230; the quality of your tests, even if you won&#8217;t give them to your customer, matter for you. They matter for your company, your image and your fellow developers, testers. They will determine their view of you who wrote them and of your abilities in ways you didn&#8217;t even think of.</p>

<p>Please care. Save a test or two. Donate to the Test Trust Fund&trade;, TTF today. Call 555-12234-Slap and be the one who cares.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for reading,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s like grammar. You think it doesn&#8217;t matter that you misspelled a word or two in an error message. Or that you have a bad name for a method or a really really critical grammatical error in a catch sentence? You think it doesn&#8217;t matter since it&#8217;s not affecting the logic of your code? Well think again. You are right in that it doesn&#8217;t affect the logic of your code ( as long as you constantly make the same grammatical error in a sentence ) but it will affect how YOU personally look like.</p>

<p>It will affect your profession. The way people think and talk about you. They won&#8217;t think that you are a professional even though your logic is solid. They will think that you are sloppy and careless. And the same goes for the quality of your tests.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #4</strong></p>

<p>Quality can determine the solidness of the logic in the test. If your quality is bad you might actually test the bad thing. Your test might actually not do what you think since you can&#8217;t even figure it out. Your test might be doing something entirely different and you wouldn&#8217;t even notice.</p>

<p>And a fautly test leaves you with a false positive and a potential very serious bug on your hand which you thought you had covered.</p>

<p><strong>Final Slap ( I mean thought )</strong></p>

<p>So&#8230; the quality of your tests, even if you won&#8217;t give them to your customer, matter for you. They matter for your company, your image and your fellow developers, testers. They will determine their view of you who wrote them and of your abilities in ways you didn&#8217;t even think of.</p>

<p>Please care. Save a test or two. Donate to the Test Trust Fund&trade;, TTF today. Call 555-12234-Slap and be the one who cares.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for reading,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.</p>

<p>Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm</p>

<p>You can try something like that:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">@After <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;">//this is cucumbers @Afters</span>

    logger.<span style="color: #006633;">log</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">"The status of the test is: "</span> <span style="color: #339933;">+</span> scenario.<span style="color: #006633;">getStatus</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
<span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>But that isn&#8217;t giving you too much now is it? And the API of scenario is as small as it can get. It offers you four options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>getStatus</li>
<li>isFailed</li>
<li>write</li>
</ul>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t help me. I wanted to get the name of the executed feature and the tags on that particular feature. I thought that&#8217;s got to be as easy as just getting a scenario accessing the feature and get the tags. Hooooowww boy I was wrong.</p>

<p>I ended up with this&#8230;.</p>

<p>Ohhhhh yes! The fields which I wanted were all private and not accessible. I&#8217;m sure there was a reason behind this decision but if it was sensible it eludes me. But in the world of programming nothing is impossible they say so there.</p>

<p>In cucumberFeature there will be everything what you need. Tags, Names, Tests, Execution time. Everything.</p>

<p>I know that cucumber runs with jUnit so if there is a better way to do this please for the love of my sanity share it with me.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>

<p>Ohhhhh yes! The fields which I wanted were all private and not accessible. I&#8217;m sure there was a reason behind this decision but if it was sensible it eludes me. But in the world of programming nothing is impossible they say so there.</p>

<p>In cucumberFeature there will be everything what you need. Tags, Names, Tests, Execution time. Everything.</p>

<p>I know that cucumber runs with jUnit so if there is a better way to do this please for the love of my sanity share it with me.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>

                        <p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>I attended a 4 day course of Groovy and Grails and this is my attempt at writing up a summary to see how much I retained. I&#8217;ll try to do this from the top of my head without peaking at my notes.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s begin.</p>

<p><strong>Introductions</strong></p>

<p>First of all, introductions. The course was held by Peter Ledbrook. He is the guy who wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grails-Action-Peter-Ledbrook/dp/1617290963/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365713080&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=peter+ledbrook" title="Grails in Action">Grails in Action</a>. He is awesome, go check him out. :: <a href="https://twitter.com/pledbrook" title="Twitter for Peter">Twitter</a> ::</p>

<p>The place where it was held is <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/" title="Skills Matter">Skillsmatter</a>. Which of course is known to all, if not, go check them out as well!</p>

<p><strong>Day One</strong></p>

<p>Day one and two were about Groovy. We were faced with the quirks and hinges of the language. First tasks were Closures and Currying both of which were really interesting. A bit of functional thinking mixed into the soup.</p>

<p>The course was divided into Peter telling us about stuff for 1:30 hours and then 1:00 hour lab work which really made the whole thing interactive. We could ask questions while he was talking which I&#8217;m sure was very distracting but I hope he is used to it by now. 😉</p>

<p>The tasks which we faced I&#8217;m sure were no real challenge for somebody who was used to thinking with closures and functions. But for us they were very intriguing.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty damn awesome.</p>

<p>For quite some time now functional languages are re-living their golden age. There are various reasons for that which I won&#8217;t list here. But it has mainly to do with scalability, concurrency and threaded programming. Also the need to eliminate boilerplate code is bigger then ever. I guess people got fed up with Java being so talkative.</p>

<p>So we moved on learning a lot about groovy and its power. We also learned some good practices from Peter what to do and what not to do. For example a line he always repeated is that he hates how a function cannot exist without a class wrapped around it. Another important thing is, which we never ever should forget, that closures are Closures. Which means they aren&#8217;t functions. They are of the type Closure.</p>

<p>And that we shouldn&#8217;t use Closures just because we can. Be sensible. If a method can achieve your task, use a method.</p>

<p><strong>Day Two</strong></p>

<p>On day 2 we got into meta-programming. That&#8217;s when the real fun started. Groovy is not only powerful and lightweight it also gives the ability to change its behaviour. Meta programming is sort of a bit new to me. So this was my first definitive intro to it. But I must say that it blew me away. The capabilities are limitless.</p>

<p>There is a class called Expando in groovy which can be used to create virtually anything on the fly what you want.</p>

<p>For example look at this code ::</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">

<p>Neat hmm? Just create expando and build up the class as you go however you want to use it.</p>

<p>And you can do this jazz to other, normal classes as well. You can add properties and methods at runtime by implementing the propertyMissing and methodMissing methods. In them afterwards you can specify some custom behaviour you would like to see. By implementing these guys you can directly control what&#8217;s happening to your class. Who is calling it how and where and why.</p>

<p>To grasp the power of metacoding and the abilities with which closures provided us with took a day to properly go over. So we moved on&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Day Three</strong></p>

<p>So groovy was over. The time has come to move on and venture into the foggy land of Grails. Turned out it wasn&#8217;t so foggy after all.</p>

<p>Grails is a rapid prototyping kind of a framework. It allows you to set up an application with a blink of an eye. And provides conventions over configuration which is a really good thing to have. But as the day was going by we realised that we would find ourself not once but many times in the bubbling boils of the underbelly of /conf.</p>

<p>Again, fortunately, it wasn&#8217;t really hard. The config was groovy and it was pretty straight forward too.</p>

<p>Our third day mostly took as off to explore scaffolding, dynamic &amp; static as well, and the interesting land of GORM Peter showed us the power of grails to create a CRUD application with in a matter of seconds / minutes ( depending on how fast your machine is ) with a fairly nice view. These types of application are usually not accepted of course as an end product&#8230; For that you need to thinker a bit here and there.</p>

<p>But things like admin portal are easily put together. So use it often and use it will and get it to know how it works.</p>

<p>In the land of GORM we explored the 4 different possibilities of data retriaval and generally how everything maps together and how GORM work with ORM.</p>

<p>The four different retrieval capabilities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where clauses</li>
<li>HQL (Hybernate Query Language)</li>
<li>Criteria searches</li>
<li>Dynamic finder methods</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of which we found very interesting in there own respective ways.</p>

<p>Example of a dynamic finder::</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">assert</span> Account.<span style="color: #006600;">findAllBy</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">*</span>PropertyName<span style="color: #66cc66;">**</span><span style="color: #aaaadd; font-weight: bold;">Modifier</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">*</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span>Parameters<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>.<span style="color: #663399;">size</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">==</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">2</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Where propertyName is the name of the property to find by, modifier can be a sql&#8217;s Like for example.</p>

<p>So this could become something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">assert</span> Hitman.<span style="color: #006600;">findAllByNameLike</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Agent %"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">==</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">15</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>That day was really knowledge packed. I don&#8217;t say I remember everything but luckily I wrote up some notes and I know what and where to look for if I would be in need of something.</p>

<p><strong>Day Four</strong></p>

<p>On the last day everybody was pretty much exhausted. It takes a lot to learn all that from 9 to 5 for 4 days. And Peter gave his best to staff that stuff into our heads and as much as possible of it. I think he did a pretty good job.</p>

<p>Last day was all about Controllers, Commands, Models, Views and GSPs and BootStrap config, Environment changes durring start up, the configurability of the whole framework, messages, templates, internationalisation and many thing more which can be easily put together.</p>

<p>It was pretty interesting. GSPs have similarities to JSPs but retained only the good parts. And although you can do JSP stuff in GSPs as well with nice embedded tags you have the ability to actually create a nice page which won&#8217;t be that big a maintenance nightmare.</p>

<p>Peter very much pressed the fact that the Controllers should be your only entry point from HTML requests and the views should be the only output of it. The controllers shouldn&#8217;t be throwing around business logic they should only act as proxies between the outer shell and the inner layering.</p>

<p>I think I understood most of the stuff which we were going through. Again, it was pretty straight forward. The application of it is what need practice.</p>

<p>Durring the course we created several applications. With dynamic scaffolding as well as static. We created and edited our own views and gsps. Created our own Controllers and what nots. One thing is clear. Grails let&#8217;s you progress a hell of a lot in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>And we were also talking about testing of course. Using Geb, Spock and the unit testing capabilities of Grails. All very powerful stuff. Spock has some impressive Mocking powers in junction with the good ol&#8217; Given When Then structure. If done correctly the test can be very fast and robust.</p>

<p>As final words we talked about plugins and the testing of Views and a bit more configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Closing words</strong></p>

<p>So all in all the course was excellent. Peter did a very good job of introducing use to Grails and Groovy. It&#8217;s a very good framework to build upon with a powerful language at our disposal. I&#8217;m pretty certain that Grails will evolve even more and be a great asset to people who choose to develop with it. Handle with Care though. Because no matter how awesome a tool is, it can always be used for bad purposes. 😉</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and have a nice day / evening.</p>

                        <p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>I attended a 4 day course of Groovy and Grails and this is my attempt at writing up a summary to see how much I retained. I&#8217;ll try to do this from the top of my head without peaking at my notes.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s begin.</p>

<p><strong>Introductions</strong></p>

<p>First of all, introductions. The course was held by Peter Ledbrook. He is the guy who wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grails-Action-Peter-Ledbrook/dp/1617290963/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365713080&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=peter+ledbrook" title="Grails in Action">Grails in Action</a>. He is awesome, go check him out. :: <a href="https://twitter.com/pledbrook" title="Twitter for Peter">Twitter</a> ::</p>

<p>The place where it was held is <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/" title="Skills Matter">Skillsmatter</a>. Which of course is known to all, if not, go check them out as well!</p>

<p><strong>Day One</strong></p>

<p>Day one and two were about Groovy. We were faced with the quirks and hinges of the language. First tasks were Closures and Currying both of which were really interesting. A bit of functional thinking mixed into the soup.</p>

<p>The course was divided into Peter telling us about stuff for 1:30 hours and then 1:00 hour lab work which really made the whole thing interactive. We could ask questions while he was talking which I&#8217;m sure was very distracting but I hope he is used to it by now. 😉</p>

<p>The tasks which we faced I&#8217;m sure were no real challenge for somebody who was used to thinking with closures and functions. But for us they were very intriguing.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty damn awesome.</p>

<p>For quite some time now functional languages are re-living their golden age. There are various reasons for that which I won&#8217;t list here. But it has mainly to do with scalability, concurrency and threaded programming. Also the need to eliminate boilerplate code is bigger then ever. I guess people got fed up with Java being so talkative.</p>

<p>So we moved on learning a lot about groovy and its power. We also learned some good practices from Peter what to do and what not to do. For example a line he always repeated is that he hates how a function cannot exist without a class wrapped around it. Another important thing is, which we never ever should forget, that closures are Closures. Which means they aren&#8217;t functions. They are of the type Closure.</p>

<p>And that we shouldn&#8217;t use Closures just because we can. Be sensible. If a method can achieve your task, use a method.</p>

<p><strong>Day Two</strong></p>

<p>On day 2 we got into meta-programming. That&#8217;s when the real fun started. Groovy is not only powerful and lightweight it also gives the ability to change its behaviour. Meta programming is sort of a bit new to me. So this was my first definitive intro to it. But I must say that it blew me away. The capabilities are limitless.</p>

<p>There is a class called Expando in groovy which can be used to create virtually anything on the fly what you want.</p>

<p>For example look at this code ::</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>

<p>Neat hmm? Just create expando and build up the class as you go however you want to use it.</p>

<p>And you can do this jazz to other, normal classes as well. You can add properties and methods at runtime by implementing the propertyMissing and methodMissing methods. In them afterwards you can specify some custom behaviour you would like to see. By implementing these guys you can directly control what&#8217;s happening to your class. Who is calling it how and where and why.</p>

<p>To grasp the power of metacoding and the abilities with which closures provided us with took a day to properly go over. So we moved on&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Day Three</strong></p>

<p>So groovy was over. The time has come to move on and venture into the foggy land of Grails. Turned out it wasn&#8217;t so foggy after all.</p>

<p>Grails is a rapid prototyping kind of a framework. It allows you to set up an application with a blink of an eye. And provides conventions over configuration which is a really good thing to have. But as the day was going by we realised that we would find ourself not once but many times in the bubbling boils of the underbelly of /conf.</p>

<p>Again, fortunately, it wasn&#8217;t really hard. The config was groovy and it was pretty straight forward too.</p>

<p>Our third day mostly took as off to explore scaffolding, dynamic &amp; static as well, and the interesting land of GORM Peter showed us the power of grails to create a CRUD application with in a matter of seconds / minutes ( depending on how fast your machine is ) with a fairly nice view. These types of application are usually not accepted of course as an end product&#8230; For that you need to thinker a bit here and there.</p>

<p>But things like admin portal are easily put together. So use it often and use it will and get it to know how it works.</p>

<p>In the land of GORM we explored the 4 different possibilities of data retriaval and generally how everything maps together and how GORM work with ORM.</p>

<p>The four different retrieval capabilities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where clauses</li>
<li>HQL (Hybernate Query Language)</li>
<li>Criteria searches</li>
<li>Dynamic finder methods</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of which we found very interesting in there own respective ways.</p>

<p>Example of a dynamic finder::</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">assert</span> Account.<span style="color: #006600;">findAllBy</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">*</span>PropertyName<span style="color: #66cc66;">**</span><span style="color: #aaaadd; font-weight: bold;">Modifier</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">*</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span>Parameters<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>.<span style="color: #663399;">size</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">==</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">2</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Where propertyName is the name of the property to find by, modifier can be a sql&#8217;s Like for example.</p>

<p>So this could become something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">assert</span> Hitman.<span style="color: #006600;">findAllByNameLike</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Agent %"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">==</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">15</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>That day was really knowledge packed. I don&#8217;t say I remember everything but luckily I wrote up some notes and I know what and where to look for if I would be in need of something.</p>

<p><strong>Day Four</strong></p>

<p>On the last day everybody was pretty much exhausted. It takes a lot to learn all that from 9 to 5 for 4 days. And Peter gave his best to staff that stuff into our heads and as much as possible of it. I think he did a pretty good job.</p>

<p>Last day was all about Controllers, Commands, Models, Views and GSPs and BootStrap config, Environment changes durring start up, the configurability of the whole framework, messages, templates, internationalisation and many thing more which can be easily put together.</p>

<p>It was pretty interesting. GSPs have similarities to JSPs but retained only the good parts. And although you can do JSP stuff in GSPs as well with nice embedded tags you have the ability to actually create a nice page which won&#8217;t be that big a maintenance nightmare.</p>

<p>Peter very much pressed the fact that the Controllers should be your only entry point from HTML requests and the views should be the only output of it. The controllers shouldn&#8217;t be throwing around business logic they should only act as proxies between the outer shell and the inner layering.</p>

<p>I think I understood most of the stuff which we were going through. Again, it was pretty straight forward. The application of it is what need practice.</p>

<p>Durring the course we created several applications. With dynamic scaffolding as well as static. We created and edited our own views and gsps. Created our own Controllers and what nots. One thing is clear. Grails let&#8217;s you progress a hell of a lot in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>And we were also talking about testing of course. Using Geb, Spock and the unit testing capabilities of Grails. All very powerful stuff. Spock has some impressive Mocking powers in junction with the good ol&#8217; Given When Then structure. If done correctly the test can be very fast and robust.</p>

<p>As final words we talked about plugins and the testing of Views and a bit more configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Closing words</strong></p>

<p>So all in all the course was excellent. Peter did a very good job of introducing use to Grails and Groovy. It&#8217;s a very good framework to build upon with a powerful language at our disposal. I&#8217;m pretty certain that Grails will evolve even more and be a great asset to people who choose to develop with it. Handle with Care though. Because no matter how awesome a tool is, it can always be used for bad purposes. 😉</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and have a nice day / evening.</p>

<p>Today I would like to show you what you need to become a Testing expert.</p>

<p>If you had noticed I deliberately left out the word Software. Why? Because becoming and expert in Testing Anything has the same root as becoming an expert to test software. And for that let me take you back to a Galaxy Far Far Away in Time AND Space.</p>

<p><strong>The beginnings&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>I went to school in Oroszlany, my home town in Hungary. My official Technical title would be Mechanical Testing Engineer. I had the luck that most things which were thought at that school and I liked were thought by people I liked too and were clever in their respective fields. Like Pneumatics, Metallurgy, Mechanics, Chemistry these were all really awesome fields. To this day I don&#8217;t know why I haven&#8217;t ended up in some lab testing the breaking point of metals and the capacity of various chemicals.</p>

<p>But ahh well.. I still remember some of the ISO standards we had to memorize. Like in Metallurgy the Charpy pendulum impact test which we loved so very much to perform. The ISO standard for that is ISO 148-1:2009. Now let me see if I still remember that correctly&#8230; Yes! I&#8217;ve still got it. So where am I going with this?</p>

<p><strong>Moving on&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Back then we performed a lot of operations on various metals and a lot of chemical testings and the like. The most important part of every performed test was always to have insight. Insight in the structure of the metal. How it was made, how it was moulded and then shaped and heated and cooled and so on and so forth. We had to know EVERYTHING about the creation of this element that we had to test. Without that knowledge you could of corse still perform the test but you didn&#8217;t had any additional information why that test was useful or what it proved. Sure, you could have looked at the specification of the metal but that didn&#8217;t give you anything about the inner structure of it.</p>

<p>That was provided to you by the knowledge of the procedure that created it.</p>

<p>You get where I&#8217;m going with this&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Insight</strong></p>

<p>So back to software testing&#8230; What is the single most important thing that gives you insight, that gives you the edge to be a professional? Knowing the development process. Knowing architecture. Knowing programming. Knowing the language and its capabilities and limitations.</p>

<p>Sure you can be a good manual Tester. Of course you can be an excellent Exploratory Tester. But look at the others. James Marcus Bach. Alan Richardson. Michael Bolton and I could go on&#8230; They all know programming. They all know it by heart and they could be exceptional programmers if they wanted to. They already know that in order to get very good at testing something you must have an insight on the subject matter. You can&#8217;t test it thoughtfully without knowing its limitations its rules that it obeys its exploits that you can use.</p>

<p><strong>Last words&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>So in order to excel at your craft of test you have to have insight of the subject of the test. You can still become good but you always have to aim high don&#8217;t you? A friend of mine reply to one of my tweets with a really good sentence:&#8221;&#8230;and then you realize that being the best in one implies being excellent in the other.&#8221;. Exactly. Because the two are interconnected. They aren&#8217;t actually two. It&#8217;s one. It&#8217;s called Engineering.</p>

<p>Have a nice day and as always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>
