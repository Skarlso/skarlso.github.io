                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>Today I want to write about a little trick I learned.</p>

<p>If you are working with legacy code and you don&#8217;t have the chance to eliminate core design problems, you can use this little pattern to help you out.</p>

<p><strong>Problem</strong></p>

<p>Problem is that you have a class that has a gazillion collaborators and at some point in time one of the clever devs thought it would be a cool idea to do dependancy injection via the constructor. We all know that doing this makes the class immutable which is very good for a number of reasons. However it doesn&#8217;t provide a flexible solution if you want to leave out one or two collabs. For that your would have to create Adapter constructors and chain them upwards which would get very ugly very fast. While using JavaBeans getters and setters can leave your class in a harmful state like not at all or partially initialised.</p>

<p>So what&#8217;s a good solution then?</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>One possible solution would be to use some kind of initialisation framework like Springs @Autowired. But cluttering your classes with that isn&#8217;t really pretty either. But it&#8217;s A solution.</p>

<p>Another solution is the usage of a builder pattern.</p>

<p>Consider this class:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">class</span> VeryImportantService <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
&nbsp;
        <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">public</span> VeryImportantService<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>CollabOne collabOne, CollabTwo collabTwo, CollabThree collabThree, CollabFour collabFour,
            CollabFive collabFive, CollabSix collabSix<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
            .
            .
            .
        <span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Don&#8217;t forget that we want these to be optional. I would like to leave out two or three here and there.</p>

<p>The builder let&#8217;s you do that. It looks something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>

<p>Now&#8230; calling this would look something like this:</p>

<pre lang="JAVA" lines="1">VeryImportantService veryImportantService = new VeryImportantService.Builder().collabOne(someValueOne).collabTwo(someValueTwo).collabFive(someValueFive);
</pre>

<p>This enables you to be flexible HOWEVER!! I HATE train wrecks. So I would probably tweak it not to return things, but set them. Then you would end up calling then line by line. Which is still not the best but better then the alternative.</p>

<p><strong>End words</strong></p>

<p>So there you go. This is A solution not THE solution obviously. The best would be to NOT design such a monster at all. If you have any better ideas please feel free to share. I would gladly put them on my blog.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

<p>Now&#8230; calling this would look something like this:</p>

<pre lang="JAVA" lines="1">VeryImportantService veryImportantService = new VeryImportantService.Builder().collabOne(someValueOne).collabTwo(someValueTwo).collabFive(someValueFive);
</pre>

<p>This enables you to be flexible HOWEVER!! I HATE train wrecks. So I would probably tweak it not to return things, but set them. Then you would end up calling then line by line. Which is still not the best but better then the alternative.</p>

<p><strong>End words</strong></p>

<p>So there you go. This is A solution not THE solution obviously. The best would be to NOT design such a monster at all. If you have any better ideas please feel free to share. I would gladly put them on my blog.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>So yesterday I was on a little gathering called <a href="http://coderetreat.org/" title="Coderetreat" target="_blank">Coderetreat</a>.</p>

<p>If you look at the link you can read everything about it. If not, I&#8217;ve provided a short description.</p>

<p><strong>What it is about?</strong></p>

<p>So what is codereatreat about? In short it&#8217;s about programmers getting together and honing and practicing there skills in order to become more at what they are doing. It&#8217;s a practice run with great people. TDDing one problem the whole day long with constantly applied constraints.</p>

<p><strong>Problem domain</strong></p>

<p>Usually it&#8217;s some kind of coding kata. This sessions problem was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Convey&#8217;s Game Of Life</a>. It&#8217;s a well known problem which you can&#8217;t really solve in the given amount of time if you do it right. But that&#8217;s not the goal anyways. The goal is the journey itself as was formulated by our facilitator.</p>

<p><strong>Process</strong></p>

<p>So what was going on there anyways? At 10:00AM the whole thing begun. Thirty developers set down, choose partners for TDD, and started to tackle the problem at hand. There were 6 sessions which lasted 45 minutes. After that a short retro and then a 10 minute break. On every session the code was deleted and rewrote from scratch. The first two sessions were introduction. And then the fun started with the constraints&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Constraints</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>first</strong> one was that we were not allowed to use any loops when solving the problem. That was a tricky one. You had several options to go on but me not being a proper developer I couldn&#8217;t think of too many. Well that&#8217;s why I was there wasn&#8217;t I? To learn. I came up with the idea of linking the cells together so when one is invalidated it notifies all his neighbours through a call. But I wasn&#8217;t sure how to implement it. Also I choose a group which worked in ruby and it was a long time ago I wrote something in that language. It was a group effort but eventually we came up with a prototype that proved the first rule. I was happy!</p>

<p>The <strong>second</strong> one was <a href="http://coderetreat.org/facilitating/activities/ping-pong" target="_blank">TDD ping pong</a>. That was a really interesting experience for me. I grouped with a guy who had already experience in code retreat session so he didn&#8217;t spare me. In addition we did silent ping pong and it was HARD! It was really hard for me to formulate my thoughts JUST in tests. So that he can get what I want and understand and agree on the design at the same time. So we ended up throwing tests at each other with the thought: Here try to solve this you bastard! It was great fun indeed!</p>

<p>The <strong>third</strong> constraint was &#8216;No conditions.&#8217;. That was the hardest for me. Coming up with recursion for the first one and having a fight in the second was nothing compared to this. Conditions are a fundamental structure of programming. It&#8217;s logic basically. You can have the cells as objects and then a world of cells linked together but you still have to somehow decide if they live or die based on neighbour count.</p>

<p>So how do you avert it? I worked with a guy in this one who was good at low level thinking. He came up with the solution of using expressions as returns for the status:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">return</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #339933;">!</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>neighbours <span style="color: #339933;">&lt;</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">2</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #339933;">||</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>neighbours <span style="color: #339933;">&gt;</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">3</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #339933;">||</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>neighbours <span style="color: #339933;">==</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">2</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #339933;">||</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>neighbours <span style="color: #339933;">==</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">3</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>It&#8217;s brilliant and easy if you see it like this but I was so used to thinking in higher structure and so used to the features given by the language, that I couldn&#8217;t have come up with this in the given amount of time. So he had the idea and I coded it down. And this is actually working&#8230; It returns true or false based on the neighbour count. And we could use that return value to change the state of the cell afterwords.</p>

<p>The <strong>fourth</strong> and last task was that everybody stand up and finish someones else code. Practicing how to handle &#8220;legacy&#8221; code and a free for all session to finish the job.</p>

<p><strong>What I learned?</strong></p>

<p>Basically I learned that I really like code. I like writing it, thinking about it, solving problems and creating good, clean, clever solutions. I might be a tester by profession and I love being a tester, but there is a coder somewhere in here too who enjoyed every bit of that session yesterday. Of course this is not the only thing I took from that. I learned good technics. I learned that I&#8217;m in a box and I need to think outside of it too. I constraint myself by depending on the language I use. And that I need to keep up practicing alas I loose my ability to solve complex logical problems by coding.</p>

<p>A coding kata a day helps keeping the bugs away. 😉</p>

<p><strong>End thoughts</strong></p>

<p>All in all the day was absolutely awesome. Great lunch and environment was provided by the host <a href="http://www.national-lottery.co.uk/" target="_blank">Camelot</a> and our fearless leader who walked around all day helping out and coordinating the whole thing <a href="www.meza.hu" target="_blank">Marton &#8216;Meza&#8217; Meszaros</a>. A big thank you and a lot of respect for doing it all day long.</p>

<p>Unfortunately because of my broken ankle I couldn&#8217;t stay for the drinks but if you ever get to a session like this I strongly recommend staying the whole day AND the night. And not just &#8217;till you stuffed your belly with free food and booze. 😉</p>

<p>And the top of the cherry is a great time laps of the whole day which can be seen here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBvMBAOQD5U" target="_blank">Coderetreat 29.09.12</a>. Enjoy as we had!</p>

                        <p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Today I want to write to you about <strong>learning</strong> something with a <strong>visual mind</strong>. There are a gazillion posts out there that tell you how to learn something with a visual mind. However, there are only a few <strong>actually describing</strong> how to learn something as complicated and logical as programming. How do you draw up a function? How do you draw up a cycle or a structure?</p>

<p>Actually these are really <strong>easy</strong>. A <strong>cycle</strong>? No problem. What&#8217;s a <strong>circle</strong> if not a cycle? <strong>Structure</strong>? This should be an easy one. You can draw a whole <strong>building</strong> and then place <strong>building blocks</strong> into it.</p>

<p>I have a very <strong>strong visual mind</strong>. I don&#8217;t remember names good for example however I remember every and each <strong>face very distinct</strong>. So if you come up to me, don&#8217;t be surprised if I don&#8217;t remember your name. So as I grew older and I took learning into my own hand I realised that there are <strong>techniques</strong> out there that I could have used to <strong>boost my learning</strong> in the early stages of my life too.</p>

<p>But there is no such thing as to be late for something. <strong>Life is constant learning</strong>. So don&#8217;t hesitate to start learning something.</p>

<p>I <strong>started</strong> to learn <strong>Scala</strong> for example and I was <strong>brainstorming</strong> as how to <strong>draw</strong> up a good map for some programming practices. <strong>Brainstorming</strong> can help you coming up with something that can <strong>display your idea</strong>. Try to brainstorm <strong>in words only</strong> rather then sentences.</p>

<p>And I came up with these two for now, with the <strong>play framework</strong> in the middle.</p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7604030/structure.png" alt="Structure" /></p>

<p><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/7604030/route.jpg" alt="Route" /></p>

<p>Now some of you <strong>might say</strong> this <strong>took long</strong> and is <strong>unnecessary</strong>. The information displayed can be <strong>remembered easily</strong> and that these drawings took longer then writing up two or three words. Now let&#8217;s see&#8230;</p>

<p>These drawing, which are really <strong>rough</strong> actually, took me about <strong>10 minutes</strong> while reading and learning and what not. Yes they take longer. But if I write down <strong>two words</strong> how long will I remember them? I already <strong>forgot after I wrote it down</strong>!</p>

<p>This drawing with the griffon legs? <strong>Stuck there forever</strong>. ( Don&#8217;t ask about the legs.. don&#8217;t know where they came from&#8230; )</p>

<p>So visualisation goes a long way in your brain if you are wired that way. Remember that there is NOTHING that you can&#8217;t display with a little bit of creativity and graphics.</p>

<p>Ohh and btw&#8230; Chances are that you only read the words in <strong>BOLD</strong> because your mind draws your attention to parts that stand out. And also you want to get over reading this article fast and you appreciate if key elements are taken out for you without the unimportant gibberish in between. 😉</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

                        <p>Aka, what you can do if you are facing and unknown framework / system you have to work with for quite some time.</p>

<p><strong>Get intimate</strong></p>

<p>You are going to live with this system for a while. The best thing you can do is getting to know it better. You have to get it to know like you would approche a fine lady. You have to ask it questions look after it, how it feels how its day was. Have to listen to what it tells you, you have to read its diary if necessary.</p>

<p>After a while you will be in a relationship with it. Now it&#8217;s time to look out for it. Nurture it. Grow it. Care for it. A good piece of software is like a happy lady. It will great you every morning and it will say good by when you go home.</p>

<p>So how do you get to know a new system better.</p>

<p><strong>Debug</strong></p>

<p>In a new system Debugging is like a good old friend who tells you a story about the lady you want to conquer. You find a workflow and execute it in debug mode and follow each and every step that it makes. This way, you will see how each package and class is coupled together. You will be able to see the connections between modules and between calls and functions. It is a good way to see the inner workings.</p>

<p><strong>Ask her girlfriend</strong></p>

<p>Nothing knows more of the system at hand as its best friend. And a good systems best friends are the tests. Take a look at the unit tests, take a look at the integration tests and the acceptance tests. These will tell you more about the system and its actual working strategy than any documentation you can put your hands on. The tests are the closest and next best thing after the real deal.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s really not that hard to get to know a large system better. Follow a main process with debug, look at the tests, talk to developers, and read some documentation about it. By the time you are done you will be best of friends and you will learn how to handle her the way she likes it. 😉</p>

<p>Hope that helped.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>It is not the best solution but this is my first try. I did it with TDD so there were tests first, which I&#8217;m not going to copy in..</p>

                        <p>My solution to the String Wrap Kata. The goal is to have it wrap a text on a given column width.</p>

<p>It is not the best solution but this is my first try. I did it with TDD so there were tests first, which I&#8217;m not going to copy in..</p>
