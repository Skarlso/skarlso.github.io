                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>Today I would like to take you on a journey I fought myself through in order to write a python android app, which gets you a random problem from <a href="http://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/" target="_blank">Sphere Judge Online</a>. Then you can mark it as solved and it will be stored as such, and you can move on to the next problem. With the words of Neil deGrasse Tyson, Come with Me!</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">
  Beginnings
</h1>

<p>When I first embarked on this endeavour I ran into numerous errors, many amongst them being compilation issues when I was trying to install libraries.</p>

<p>I started to write down all of these, and then started fresh on a new machine. I realised that ALL of my problems where only because of <strong>ONE </strong>thing. One thing, which I wanted to do, but it ended up being the death of me. And that is&#8230;. *Drummrolls* <strong>Python 3. </strong>I tried doing all the things that I started to do, with Python 3. Turns out, that neither libraries are supporting it very well yet. And that&#8217;s including Cython as well, which I thought would be up to speed by now. But sadly, it&#8217;s not.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">
  Prerequisite
</h1>

<p>In order to go any further we need a few things first. For this to work, you&#8217;ll have to perform these things in order as I found out later. And certain versions of certain libraries are required instead of the latest ones.</p>

<p>Depending on the environment you are using, you need to install python-dev and some other graphic libraries. I followed this and that was fine. Latest packages are working alright.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">apt-get install</span> build-essential <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">patch</span> git-core ccache ant python-pip python-dev
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">apt-get install</span> ia32-libs  libc6-dev-i386
<span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">apt-get install</span> lib32stdc++<span style="color: #000000;">6</span> lib32z1</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Only install these if you are absolutely certain you need them.</p>

<p>Clone python-android from git into a nice and cosy directory.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">git clone</span> https:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>github.com<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>kivy<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>python-for-android.git</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>While this is underway, for python-android you also need <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other" target="_blank">android-sdk</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html" target="_blank">android-ndk</a>. Select the ones which are for your environment. The NDK is needed in order to build the APK out of our python code later on.</p>

<p>After you are done, run ./android and install tools, APIs and other things you want. Make sure you have these set up:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">export</span> <span style="color: #007800;">ANDROIDSDK</span>=<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>path<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>to<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>android-sdk

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<pre>export PATH=$ANDROIDNDK:$ANDROIDSDK/platform-tools:$ANDROIDSDK/tools:$PATH</pre>

<p>The API version needs to be the one which you installed on your machine.</p>

<p>Now, we have to get a specific version of Cython. In order to do that, execute the following command:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> pip <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">install</span> <span style="color: #660033;">-I</span> https:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>pypi.python.org<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>packages<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>source<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>C<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>Cython<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>Cython-0.20.1.tar.gz</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Source your new .bash_profile file if you haven&#8217;t done so already.</p>

<p>At this point we are ready to install Kivy. Please follow the instructions for your environment on the respective page from Kivy&#8217;s documentation:</p>

<p><a href="http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html">http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html</a></a></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: For Mac users. In addition, before doing the kivy stuff, and if you would like to execute kivy applications on your mac, you need to install pygame.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a bit of a hassle but you only need to perform these commands:</p>

<p>Install Quartz =&gt; <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/" target="_blank"><a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/</a></a></p>

<p>Install Homebrew =&gt; <span style="color: #ff9900;">ruby -e &#8220;$(curl -fsSL <a href="https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)&amp;#8221">https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)&amp;#8221</a>;</span></p>

<p>Install some other packages =&gt; <span style="color: #ff9900;">brew install hg sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf portmidi</span></p>

<p>Install pygame =&gt; <span style="color: #ff9900;">pip install hg+<a href="http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame">http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame</a></span></p>

<p>Once this finishes, you should be good to go for the final command in the prerequisites. Go to your cloned python-android folder and run this (make sure you have ANT installed):</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">.<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>distribute.sh <span style="color: #660033;">-m</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"openssl pil kivy"</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now we are ready for some coding.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">
  Implementation

<p>So, finally after our environment is all setup, we can move on to write some python code. Let&#8217;s start with a simple hello world application:</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This is a simple Hello World python-android app. Save this into a file called <span style="color: #ff9900;">main.py</span>. Main.py is used to execute the app on your phone. It&#8217;s your entry point. Whatever app you are writing, this has to be where it will begin.</p>

<p>In order to get this installed on our device, we will use python-android&#8217;s distribution.sh. The command to run after you changed directory into python-android is this (make sure that you have a compatible android device plugged in and in developer mode):</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">.<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>build.py <span style="color: #660033;">--package</span> org.hello.world <span style="color: #660033;">--name</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"Hello world"</span> <span style="color: #660033;">--version</span> <span style="color: #000000;">1.0</span> <span style="color: #660033;">--dir</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>PATH<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>TO<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>helloworld debug installd</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Upon success, you should see it on your device. This is how the hello world app looks like:</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">
  Finishing up

<p>This has been quite the ride so far. We will continue our journey when I&#8217;ll start writing my own app for SPOJ.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!

<p>The API version needs to be the one which you installed on your machine.</p>

<p>Now, we have to get a specific version of Cython. In order to do that, execute the following command:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sudo</span> pip <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">install</span> <span style="color: #660033;">-I</span> https:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>pypi.python.org<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>packages<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>source<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>C<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>Cython<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>Cython-0.20.1.tar.gz</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Source your new .bash_profile file if you haven&#8217;t done so already.</p>

<p>At this point we are ready to install Kivy. Please follow the instructions for your environment on the respective page from Kivy&#8217;s documentation:</p>

<p><a href="http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html">http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html</a></a></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: For Mac users. In addition, before doing the kivy stuff, and if you would like to execute kivy applications on your mac, you need to install pygame.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a bit of a hassle but you only need to perform these commands:</p>

<p>Install Quartz =&gt; <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/" target="_blank"><a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/">http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/</a></a></p>

<p>Install Homebrew =&gt; <span style="color: #ff9900;">ruby -e &#8220;$(curl -fsSL <a href="https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)&amp;#8221">https://raw.github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/go/install)&amp;#8221</a>;</span></p>

<p>Install some other packages =&gt; <span style="color: #ff9900;">brew install hg sdl sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf portmidi</span></p>

<p>Install pygame =&gt; <span style="color: #ff9900;">pip install hg+<a href="http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame">http://bitbucket.org/pygame/pygame</a></span></p>

<p>Once this finishes, you should be good to go for the final command in the prerequisites. Go to your cloned python-android folder and run this (make sure you have ANT installed):</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">.<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>distribute.sh <span style="color: #660033;">-m</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"openssl pil kivy"</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now we are ready for some coding.</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">
  Implementation

<p>So, finally after our environment is all setup, we can move on to write some python code. Let&#8217;s start with a simple hello world application:</p>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This is a simple Hello World python-android app. Save this into a file called <span style="color: #ff9900;">main.py</span>. Main.py is used to execute the app on your phone. It&#8217;s your entry point. Whatever app you are writing, this has to be where it will begin.</p>

<p>In order to get this installed on our device, we will use python-android&#8217;s distribution.sh. The command to run after you changed directory into python-android is this (make sure that you have a compatible android device plugged in and in developer mode):</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Upon success, you should see it on your device. This is how the hello world app looks like:</p>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">
  Finishing up

<p>This has been quite the ride so far. We will continue our journey when I&#8217;ll start writing my own app for SPOJ.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>In my previous post, I was getting ready to enjoy some time with the JavaScript web framework Meteor.</p>

<p>This time I would like to bring it to a bit of overdrive. See, how re-factoring works on a larger scale model with multiple pages. And how it can organize assets, such as, images, multiple CSS, some plugins, you know, ordinary web stuff.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m planning this to be a series of posts as I&#8217;m going along building up my RPG app. Let&#8217;s define the rules.</p>

<h1 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning</h1>

<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="inventory">Inventory</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our main character will have a basic inventory. He will have space to carry stuff around and a body to put stuff on. One ring on each hand, one weapon in each hand, helmet, armour, legs, and a necklace. That&#8217;s it. For simplicities sake. The game mechanics will be like those old books which you could play, Fighting RPG Books, like the one Ian Livingstone was writing. This is one of my favourites; Robot commando:</p>

<h4 id="stats">Stats</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A very basic stat system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Agility</li>
<li>Constitution</li>
<li>Intelligence</li>
<li>Magic</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="fighting">Fighting</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A very basic fighting system with the possibility of casting magic which, for simplicity, will count as attacks and can be dodged based on agility.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say we have dice throwing with a couple of 6 sided ones. So X * 6 sided dice. Dodging will require agility, HP is defined by constitution, Intelligence will help in puzzles which require a throw against intelligence, Magic will define Mana Points.</p>

<p>Simple, right?</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not much of a front-end developer, so I don&#8217;t really care about how it will look like. I&#8217;ll try to squeeze in some very basic stuff, like ordering, but that&#8217;s it.</p>

<h3 id="game-play">Game Play</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Basically there will be a story which can be loaded threw a JSON structured file. The file will hold information about what a current page has. The probable things a page can contain at any given time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Current location description</li>
<li>Selectable proceed location ( page number )</li>
<li>Enemy -&gt; Fight ( Might contain an option to not to attack the beast )</li>
<li>Riddle -&gt; Solving it is determined by a throw against intelligence</li>
<li>Trap -&gt; Springing it is determined by a throw against agility</li>
<li>Lootable items</li>
<li>Death</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above define an action that a player can, or HAS to take. If there is no ability to choose the player has to proceed as the page requests it. That might be easier to do if I just say if there is only one possible choose it&#8217;s choosen automatically for you.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be using Meteor which is based on Node and MongoDB. Hence, my stuff will be in mongoDB. I have a fair knowledge of how mongodb works, I&#8217;ll write down my progress as I go along.</p>

<p>Everything I&#8217;ll do is of course under version control and can be followed here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/coolrpgapp" target="_blank"><a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/coolrpgapp">https://github.com/Skarlso/coolrpgapp</a></a></p>

<h4 id="character">Character</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I need to be able to create a character with a name. Meaning, I need to figure out how meteor handles input. I already know that it uses templates and <a href="https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/spacebars/README.md" target="_blank">Spacebars Compiler</a>. So what I want at this point is to enter a username and then click a button which will direct me to the story page. Simple, right&#8230;?</p>

<p>For data handling we will use Meteor&#8217;s <a href="https://www.meteor.com/try/3" target="_blank">Collections</a>.</p>

<p>Using a form to submit the username looks like this:</p>

<p>Of course there is no way to know if that actually succeeded so far unless I get a look at the DB. Navigate to the folder of your app and type in:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor mongo</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This will open a console to your database where you can query it like you would normally do with a mongodb console. Hence for me it&#8217;s:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">db.usernames.find<span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;"># which return this -&gt;</span>

<p>As you can see, I already have two characters in the system. This is so far very easy but it does not redirect me to a new page displaying the beginning of my journey. Let&#8217;s try a redirect.</p>

<h1 id="complications">Complications</h1>

<p>Turns out it&#8217;s not that easy to get a redirect going. If I would be a beginner at this, I would give up right now and move on. The guide, or the tutorial does not contain any HINTS at least that I have to use a different method if I want a multi-layered multi-paged app. Of course Meteor provides a built in, easy to use, easy to add, answer-to-everything-you-ever-would-want-to-do, Login feature. But guys, it&#8217;s not useful. I would go as far as say it&#8217;s completely useless. Do you actually know someone who uses it? I would never use a built in something which is completely hidden from me and have no idea what it does. The ability to control what&#8217;s happening is THE most important thing in every developers life.</p>

<p>So after I did a bit of digging and StackOverflowing ( which replaces the tutorial AND the user guide (and is a trademarked expression)), I found out that you can add <a href="https://atmospherejs.com/cmather/iron-router" target="_blank">Iron-Router</a> which was built specifically for this purpose.</p>

<pre>meteor add iron:router</pre>

<p>So all of a sudden my Page is completely screwed up with Iron Router information. Again, there is no information on this on Meteors page or in the guide nor in the COMPLETE guide so, I&#8217;m left Googling.</p>

<p>A very helpful StackOverflow ( again, and I&#8217;m wondering why people don&#8217;t bother with the guide in the first place just go to stackoverflow straight ) answer explains to me the following:</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>You have to define a subscription handle (an object returned by Meteor.subscribe) in order to use it&#8217;s reactive ready method : we&#8217;ll reference it in the myDataIsReady helper to track data availability, and the helper will automatically rerun when the state of ready changes.</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>Okay, so subscriptions are mentioned in the SECURITY section of the guide regarding detecting specific users and private data and so on and so forth. All right so that&#8217;s used by iron routing as well which means I have to build that in, and not to mention first of all understanding how Iron Router works.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m going to stop here now. After spending a couple of hours I can determine that this stuff is not intuitive and &#8220;easy&#8221;. I don&#8217;t know enough about JavaScript and redirecting and Iron Router to be able to use Meteor out of the box. Which means I have to educate myself a bit before returning to this stuff.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>And as always,
Thanks for reading!</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>In my previous post, I was getting ready to enjoy some time with the JavaScript web framework Meteor.</p>

<p>This time I would like to bring it to a bit of overdrive. See, how re-factoring works on a larger scale model with multiple pages. And how it can organize assets, such as, images, multiple CSS, some plugins, you know, ordinary web stuff.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s dive in.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m planning this to be a series of posts as I&#8217;m going along building up my RPG app. Let&#8217;s define the rules.</p>

<h1 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning</h1>

<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="inventory">Inventory</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our main character will have a basic inventory. He will have space to carry stuff around and a body to put stuff on. One ring on each hand, one weapon in each hand, helmet, armour, legs, and a necklace. That&#8217;s it. For simplicities sake. The game mechanics will be like those old books which you could play, Fighting RPG Books, like the one Ian Livingstone was writing. This is one of my favourites; Robot commando:</p>

<h4 id="stats">Stats</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A very basic stat system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Strength</li>
<li>Agility</li>
<li>Constitution</li>
<li>Intelligence</li>
<li>Magic</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 id="fighting">Fighting</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A very basic fighting system with the possibility of casting magic which, for simplicity, will count as attacks and can be dodged based on agility.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say we have dice throwing with a couple of 6 sided ones. So X * 6 sided dice. Dodging will require agility, HP is defined by constitution, Intelligence will help in puzzles which require a throw against intelligence, Magic will define Mana Points.</p>

<p>Simple, right?</p>

<h3 id="design">Design</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not much of a front-end developer, so I don&#8217;t really care about how it will look like. I&#8217;ll try to squeeze in some very basic stuff, like ordering, but that&#8217;s it.</p>

<h3 id="game-play">Game Play</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Basically there will be a story which can be loaded threw a JSON structured file. The file will hold information about what a current page has. The probable things a page can contain at any given time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Current location description</li>
<li>Selectable proceed location ( page number )</li>
<li>Enemy -&gt; Fight ( Might contain an option to not to attack the beast )</li>
<li>Riddle -&gt; Solving it is determined by a throw against intelligence</li>
<li>Trap -&gt; Springing it is determined by a throw against agility</li>
<li>Lootable items</li>
<li>Death</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above define an action that a player can, or HAS to take. If there is no ability to choose the player has to proceed as the page requests it. That might be easier to do if I just say if there is only one possible choose it&#8217;s choosen automatically for you.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll be using Meteor which is based on Node and MongoDB. Hence, my stuff will be in mongoDB. I have a fair knowledge of how mongodb works, I&#8217;ll write down my progress as I go along.</p>

<p>Everything I&#8217;ll do is of course under version control and can be followed here:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/coolrpgapp" target="_blank"><a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/coolrpgapp">https://github.com/Skarlso/coolrpgapp</a></a></p>

<h4 id="character">Character</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I need to be able to create a character with a name. Meaning, I need to figure out how meteor handles input. I already know that it uses templates and <a href="https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/spacebars/README.md" target="_blank">Spacebars Compiler</a>. So what I want at this point is to enter a username and then click a button which will direct me to the story page. Simple, right&#8230;?</p>

<p>For data handling we will use Meteor&#8217;s <a href="https://www.meteor.com/try/3" target="_blank">Collections</a>.</p>

<p>Using a form to submit the username looks like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">

<span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Of course there is no way to know if that actually succeeded so far unless I get a look at the DB. Navigate to the folder of your app and type in:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor mongo</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This will open a console to your database where you can query it like you would normally do with a mongodb console. Hence for me it&#8217;s:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">db.usernames.find<span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;"># which return this -&gt;</span>

    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>As you can see, I already have two characters in the system. This is so far very easy but it does not redirect me to a new page displaying the beginning of my journey. Let&#8217;s try a redirect.</p>

<h1 id="complications">Complications</h1>

<p>Turns out it&#8217;s not that easy to get a redirect going. If I would be a beginner at this, I would give up right now and move on. The guide, or the tutorial does not contain any HINTS at least that I have to use a different method if I want a multi-layered multi-paged app. Of course Meteor provides a built in, easy to use, easy to add, answer-to-everything-you-ever-would-want-to-do, Login feature. But guys, it&#8217;s not useful. I would go as far as say it&#8217;s completely useless. Do you actually know someone who uses it?

                        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>This time I would like to write about something that interests me. I wanted to try out a pure JavaScript web framework.</p>

<p>My choice is: <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a>. Looks interesting enough and it was recommended by a friend of mine. So, let&#8217;s dive in.</p>

<h4 id="installation"><strong>Installation</strong></h4>

<p>As always, one starts with installation. The page tells us to follow this simple step:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">curl https:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>install.meteor.com<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">|</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sh</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Easy enough, when you are on Linux. Turns out, that there is no official release yet for Windows. I&#8217;m in luck then. After running the command though, I saw this popping up into my face:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">curl: <span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #000000;">60</span><span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#41;</span> Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with known CA certificates
More details here: http:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>curl.haxx.se<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>docs<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>sslcerts.html</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>There is always something&#8230; in that case a more accurate command to use would be the following:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">curl <span style="color: #660033;">-k</span> https:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>install.meteor.com<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">|</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sh</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This will force an insecure download. You might not face this issue, but just in case you do, use this command instead.</p>

<p>Branching off here. For those of you whom the curl didn&#8217;t work because you are sitting behind a proxy you can specify a &#8211;proxy  protocol//username:password@proxy:port after your curl. Of course if that doesn&#8217;t work then the script won&#8217;t work either.</p>

<p>So open the script in one of your favourite editors, for me it&#8217;s Sublime text, and find this line: &#8220;<em>Downloading Meteor distribution</em>&#8220;. Lo, and behold; it uses curl. This is the only one in the script, so just edit it by adding in your &#8211;proxy setting as before and you should be right on track.</p>

<p>If that still gives you problems, try this:</p>

<p>Assuming that your browser is set up correctly with the proxy and just command line commands aren&#8217;t working, you can go to this URL defined by the variable TARBALL_URL:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">

<h4 id="getting-started">Getting started</h4>

<p>After a nice installation process we can continue to the getting started phase.</p>

<p>So, the documentation tells us that we have to simply execute a command.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor create simple-todos</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>At this point we should get a directory structure which is written in the manual. And, behold, that&#8217;s exactly what happened. As usually, creating a skeleton is easy. Lets run the app. For that, the command is:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>I can do that, I think.</p>

<p>And sure enough, I&#8217;ve got this little message, which I actually expected to see:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">Can<span style="color: #ff0000;">'t listen on port 3000. Perhaps another Meteor is running?</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>In this world, where there are tons of applications running on your dev environment at any given time, it&#8217;s possible to have something already running on the port 3000. Luckily this is something that&#8217;s anticipated by now, and we are presented with an option to add in a proxy setting of our choice with &#8211;port <port>.</p>

<p>After I did that, I&#8217;ve got a nice confirm message that meteor is up and running. A quick check on the presented URL provided me with the confidence that my app is indeed reachable.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">App running at: http:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>localhost:<span style="color: #000000;">9999</span><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<h4 id="after-getting-started-8230">After Getting Started&#8230;</h4>

<p>Now that we know that it&#8217;s up and running we can continue with the tutorial. Up comes next a simple Todo list application with Templates. It&#8217;s telling us to replace the code in the default starter app. At this point I&#8217;m wondering if it can hotswap. It should, since javascript and HTML is dynamic so there should be no problems there, right?</p>

<p>And sure enough, the moment I replaced the code and checked on my server status, I could see this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">Client modified <span style="color: #660033;">--</span> refreshing
Meteor server restarted</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>With a brief flash of &#8220;Rebuilding&#8230;&#8221;. So it does sort of work. It did, however, restart the server it just did it without your manual intervention. Which is nice, but on a larger scale application it might prove to be a tad bit annoying. For example, I add another item to the list, and suddenly, the server is restarted.</p>

<p>Since, I am a tester, let&#8217;s see how it handles some problems.</p>

<p>I modified the JavaScript so that it has a syntax error.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="javascript" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #006600; font-style: italic;">// simple-todos.js</span>

<span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Note the missing &#8220;,&#8221;. And, nicely enough I&#8217;m getting an error message telling me that I messed something up:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">Errors prevented startup:
&nbsp;
While building the application:
my_cool_app.js:<span style="color: #000000;">10</span>:<span style="color: #000000;">7</span>: Unexpected token <span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#123;</span>
&nbsp;

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>It even tells you where the error is and it&#8217;s waiting for you to fix it. After I&#8217;ve corrected my error it compiled fine and the application is up and running. Deleting the files did little difference as did corrupting the HTML pages or the CSS file. Nothing to see here, moving on&#8230;</p>

<h4 id="android-device">Android Device</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m sure everybody can read a manual and continue with collections, forms, events and such. What I&#8217;m more interested in is that Meteor promises it can run on Android devices. Now that perked my curiosity. With the rise of mobile devices, the desktop platform is slowly pushed back into a dark corner where even a <a href="http://mistborn.wikia.com/wiki/Tineye" target="_blank">Tineye </a>would have problems seeing it.</p>

<p>Hence, I want to see how easy it really is.</p>

<p>Meteor gives you a set of commands to install the android sdk and droid support for your application, which is nice. You just need to run this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor install-sdk android
meteor add-platform android <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;"># Perform this step in the app's folder and agree to terms and conditions.</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now, if you are like me, someone who has experience with the android SDK and its emulator, you&#8217;ll know that running that thing requires more time and processing power than simulating the chances of Leonardo DiCaprio winning an Oscar. I&#8217;ll use a real device instead. For that, it appears I only have to run a simple command again.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor run android-device</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>And sure enough the app appeared on my device.</p>

<p>This is actually quite awesome. I only plugged in my device, enabled developer options and USB debugging and that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m quite impressed so far with Meteor and the Power of JavaScript. The app is on my phone and the static JavaScript parts are still working even though I shut the server down.</p>

<p>So my next burning question is&#8230; Will it Blend? I mean, Perform?</p>

<h4 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h4>

<p>So, now that I know that using, installing and getting started is pretty simple, what I also would like to know is how well it performs.</p>

<p>I have a quad core i7 16GB RAM Samsung SSD running Linux. Let&#8217;s see 100 threads 10 second interval 10 times loop for a start. Look at how gorgeous this is.</p>

<p>40ms on average. Now let&#8217;s crank it up and I&#8217;m performing the test on a separate machine but still on the same network. 1000 threads.</p>

<p>This time I&#8217;ve got a bit more churn and my pc started to fan like there is no tomorrow. But the server stayed stable. Latency did not waver for a bit. Next, 10.000 for as long as my machine can handle it&#8230;. Better save my work. Hah, my JMeter died. But it clocked at an average of 1000ms response time and the server stayed absolutely stable with no package lost, or errors.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>I can say with a full heart that I&#8217;m impressed by Meteor and I very much like it. It&#8217;s easy to use, even more easy to install and definitely can handle itself given that it&#8217;s rather lightweight. The hot swapping / server re-starting can&#8217;t be avoided, but that&#8217;s only a minor inconvenience and we got used to that already.</p>

<p>I recommend Meteor and I&#8217;ll be playing around with it a bit more for sure.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>This time I would like to write about something that interests me. I wanted to try out a pure JavaScript web framework.</p>

<p>My choice is: <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a>. Looks interesting enough and it was recommended by a friend of mine. So, let&#8217;s dive in.</p>

<h4 id="installation"><strong>Installation</strong></h4>

<p>As always, one starts with installation. The page tells us to follow this simple step:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">curl https:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>install.meteor.com<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">|</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sh</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Easy enough, when you are on Linux. Turns out, that there is no official release yet for Windows. I&#8217;m in luck then. After running the command though, I saw this popping up into my face:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">curl: <span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #000000;">60</span><span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#41;</span> Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with known CA certificates
More details here: http:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>curl.haxx.se<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>docs<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>sslcerts.html</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>There is always something&#8230; in that case a more accurate command to use would be the following:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">curl <span style="color: #660033;">-k</span> https:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>install.meteor.com<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">|</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sh</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This will force an insecure download. You might not face this issue, but just in case you do, use this command instead.</p>

<p>Branching off here. For those of you whom the curl didn&#8217;t work because you are sitting behind a proxy you can specify a &#8211;proxy  protocol//username:password@proxy:port after your curl. Of course if that doesn&#8217;t work then the script won&#8217;t work either.</p>

<p>So open the script in one of your favourite editors, for me it&#8217;s Sublime text, and find this line: &#8220;<em>Downloading Meteor distribution</em>&#8220;. Lo, and behold; it uses curl. This is the only one in the script, so just edit it by adding in your &#8211;proxy setting as before and you should be right on track.</p>

<p>If that still gives you problems, try this:</p>

<p>Assuming that your browser is set up correctly with the proxy and just command line commands aren&#8217;t working, you can go to this URL defined by the variable TARBALL_URL:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #007800;">TARBALL_URL</span>=<span style="color: #ff0000;">"https://d3sqy0vbqsdhku.cloudfront.net/packages-bootstrap/<span style="color: #007800;">${RELEASE}</span>/meteor-bootstrap-<span style="color: #007800;">${PLATFORM}</span>.tar.gz"</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Note that there are two variables in there. For me these are:</p>

<p>RELEASE: 1.0.3.1</p>

<p>PLATFORM: os.linux.x86_64</p>

<p>The full URL is:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">https:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>d3sqy0vbqsdhku.cloudfront.net<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>packages-bootstrap<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>1.0.3.1<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>meteor-bootstrap-os.linux.x86_64.tar.gz</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Download the latest tarball and delete the CURL AND TAR command on the following line. After that, you just have to extract the tarball and move the directory to ~/.meteor.</p>

<p>Now you can run your sh again and you should be on the road, for sure this time.</p>

<p>Just to make sure, these are the line which you need to comment out:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>

<h4 id="getting-started">Getting started</h4>

<p>After a nice installation process we can continue to the getting started phase.</p>

<p>So, the documentation tells us that we have to simply execute a command.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor create simple-todos</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>At this point we should get a directory structure which is written in the manual. And, behold, that&#8217;s exactly what happened. As usually, creating a skeleton is easy. Lets run the app. For that, the command is:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>I can do that, I think.</p>

<p>And sure enough, I&#8217;ve got this little message, which I actually expected to see:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">Can<span style="color: #ff0000;">'t listen on port 3000. Perhaps another Meteor is running?</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>In this world, where there are tons of applications running on your dev environment at any given time, it&#8217;s possible to have something already running on the port 3000. Luckily this is something that&#8217;s anticipated by now, and we are presented with an option to add in a proxy setting of our choice with &#8211;port <port>.</p>

<p>After I did that, I&#8217;ve got a nice confirm message that meteor is up and running. A quick check on the presented URL provided me with the confidence that my app is indeed reachable.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">App running at: http:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>localhost:<span style="color: #000000;">9999</span><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<h4 id="after-getting-started-8230">After Getting Started&#8230;</h4>

<p>Now that we know that it&#8217;s up and running we can continue with the tutorial. Up comes next a simple Todo list application with Templates. It&#8217;s telling us to replace the code in the default starter app. At this point I&#8217;m wondering if it can hotswap. It should, since javascript and HTML is dynamic so there should be no problems there, right?</p>

<p>And sure enough, the moment I replaced the code and checked on my server status, I could see this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">Client modified <span style="color: #660033;">--</span> refreshing
Meteor server restarted</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>With a brief flash of &#8220;Rebuilding&#8230;&#8221;. So it does sort of work. It did, however, restart the server it just did it without your manual intervention. Which is nice, but on a larger scale application it might prove to be a tad bit annoying. For example, I add another item to the list, and suddenly, the server is restarted.</p>

<p>Since, I am a tester, let&#8217;s see how it handles some problems.</p>

<p>I modified the JavaScript so that it has a syntax error.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">

<span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Note the missing &#8220;,&#8221;. And, nicely enough I&#8217;m getting an error message telling me that I messed something up:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">Errors prevented startup:
&nbsp;
While building the application:
my_cool_app.js:<span style="color: #000000;">10</span>:<span style="color: #000000;">7</span>: Unexpected token <span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#123;</span>
&nbsp;

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>It even tells you where the error is and it&#8217;s waiting for you to fix it. After I&#8217;ve corrected my error it compiled fine and the application is up and running. Deleting the files did little difference as did corrupting the HTML pages or the CSS file. Nothing to see here, moving on&#8230;</p>

<h4 id="android-device">Android Device</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m sure everybody can read a manual and continue with collections, forms, events and such. What I&#8217;m more interested in is that Meteor promises it can run on Android devices. Now that perked my curiosity. With the rise of mobile devices, the desktop platform is slowly pushed back into a dark corner where even a <a href="http://mistborn.wikia.com/wiki/Tineye" target="_blank">Tineye </a>would have problems seeing it.</p>

<p>Hence, I want to see how easy it really is.</p>

<p>Meteor gives you a set of commands to install the android sdk and droid support for your application, which is nice. You just need to run this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor install-sdk android
meteor add-platform android <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;"># Perform this step in the app's folder and agree to terms and conditions.</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now, if you are like me, someone who has experience with the android SDK and its emulator, you&#8217;ll know that running that thing requires more time and processing power than simulating the chances of Leonardo DiCaprio winning an Oscar. I&#8217;ll use a real device instead. For that, it appears I only have to run a simple command again.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor run android-device</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>And sure enough the app appeared on my device.</p>

<p>This is actually quite awesome. I only plugged in my device, enabled developer options and USB debugging and that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m quite impressed so far with Meteor and the Power of JavaScript. The app is on my phone and the static JavaScript parts are still working even though I shut the server down.</p>

<p>So my next burning question is&#8230; Will it Blend? I mean, Perform?</p>

<h4 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h4>

<p>So, now that I know that using, installing and getting started is pretty simple, what I also would like to know is how well it performs.</p>

<p>I have a quad core i7 16GB RAM Samsung SSD running Linux. Let&#8217;s see 100 threads 10 second interval 10 times loop for a start. Look at how gorgeous this is.</p>

<p>40ms on average. Now let&#8217;s crank it up and I&#8217;m performing the test on a separate machine but still on the same network. 1000 threads.</p>

<p>This time I&#8217;ve got a bit more churn and my pc started to fan like there is no tomorrow. But the server stayed stable. Latency did not waver for a bit. Next, 10.000 for as long as my machine can handle it&#8230;. Better save my work. Hah, my JMeter died. But it clocked at an average of 1000ms response time and the server stayed absolutely stable with no package lost, or errors.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>I can say with a full heart that I&#8217;m impressed by Meteor and I very much like it. It&#8217;s easy to use, even more easy to install and definitely can handle itself given that it&#8217;s rather lightweight. The hot swapping / server re-starting can&#8217;t be avoided, but that&#8217;s only a minor inconvenience and we got used to that already.</p>

<p>I recommend Meteor and I&#8217;ll be playing around with it a bit more for sure.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>This time I&#8217;d like to write about the expressiveness of a Test. I think that it&#8217;s very important to write understandable and expressive tests. In older times I was studying novel writing. There is a rule which a novel needs to follow. It goes something like this: &#8220;A novel needs to lead its reader and make him understand in the simplest way what&#8217;s going on, with whom and why?&#8221;. In other words, it&#8217;s not a puzzle. It should be obvious what the test is trying to do and it should not require the reader to try and solve it in order to understand it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m planning this as a series since there are multiple problems with a test I can talk about here.</p>

<p><strong>Geb Tests</strong></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at homepages"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I entir my credential"</span>
            filloutLoginForm<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I can accass my wallet"</span>
            openWallet<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> <span style="color: #CC0099;">contains</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Balance"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now, read this test. It doesn&#8217;t really make any sense at the first read, right? You need to actually think what is going on there. Of course if you read it slow enough you&#8217;ll get what it&#8217;s trying to do. But you don&#8217;t know what fillform does. Apparently it also submits the form because after fillform you are suddenly at MyAccountPage.</p>

<p>There are several things wrong with this one, let&#8217;s start with the pageobject.</p>

<p><strong>PageObjects</strong></p>

<p>At and toAt return page objects. We can use that to actually make the calling explicit and make it more readable and identify where a function comes from.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at homepages"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I entir my credential"</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I can accass my wallet"</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> <span style="color: #CC0099;">contains</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Balance"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This reads much better now. You know where the function is coming from and your IDE will not go nuts from things it can&#8217;t find. And you have autocompletion so there is no fear that you simply mistype something.</p>

<p><strong>Side effects</strong></p>

<p>Next step, let&#8217;s remove some of the side effects.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">

&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I can accass my wallet"</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>

    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>

<p>Now this is again much better. There are no steps left out. And you can test now the FillForm and the submit independently. Like, submitting the form without filling it out! Or filling it out and not submiting it. Reads better, is explicit, more easy to understand.</p>

<p>And the last one for today:</p>

<p><strong>Grammar</strong></p>

<p>I wonder if you noticed it&#8230; The grammar is a little bit off in the tests. A small mistake here and there. You might think that, who cares? That&#8217;s a very bad thought. I think the correct grammar reflects caring. It reflects that we thought about this test and that we thought about the quality of it. Because it means that after you wrote it, you actually re-read the test to make sure it&#8217;s understandable and readable.</p>

<p>So let us correct that:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"As a player I can log in to check my account."</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at the homepage"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I enter my log in credentials."</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">submitLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I'm directed to my account page."</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">accountIsDisplayed</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>I also took the liberty of re-phrasing some of the text so that it shows what the test is about and what the user really would like to achieve here. Now try reading that last one. Does it make more sense? Did you understand it at first go? Did it read like a good story?</p>

<p>There is a coding practice which goes something like this: &#8220;Good code is code which doesn&#8217;t surprise you as you read it.&#8221; Which means the exact thing happens which you thought of would happen. I think that applies to tests as well. The steps of the test shouldn&#8217;t come to you as a surprise. Especially if you know what the application is supposed to do.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s all for today folks. Thank you for reading! If you have a nasty test which you would like me to dissect and make it better and human readable, please share it in the comment section and I will do my best to come up with a good solution for it.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>This time I&#8217;d like to write about the expressiveness of a Test. I think that it&#8217;s very important to write understandable and expressive tests. In older times I was studying novel writing. There is a rule which a novel needs to follow. It goes something like this: &#8220;A novel needs to lead its reader and make him understand in the simplest way what&#8217;s going on, with whom and why?&#8221;. In other words, it&#8217;s not a puzzle. It should be obvious what the test is trying to do and it should not require the reader to try and solve it in order to understand it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m planning this as a series since there are multiple problems with a test I can talk about here.</p>

<p><strong>Geb Tests</strong></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at homepages"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I entir my credential"</span>
            filloutLoginForm<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I can accass my wallet"</span>
            openWallet<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> <span style="color: #CC0099;">contains</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Balance"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now, read this test. It doesn&#8217;t really make any sense at the first read, right? You need to actually think what is going on there. Of course if you read it slow enough you&#8217;ll get what it&#8217;s trying to do. But you don&#8217;t know what fillform does. Apparently it also submits the form because after fillform you are suddenly at MyAccountPage.</p>

<p>There are several things wrong with this one, let&#8217;s start with the pageobject.</p>

<p><strong>PageObjects</strong></p>

<p>At and toAt return page objects. We can use that to actually make the calling explicit and make it more readable and identify where a function comes from.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at homepages"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I entir my credential"</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I can accass my wallet"</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> <span style="color: #CC0099;">contains</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Balance"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This reads much better now. You know where the function is coming from and your IDE will not go nuts from things it can&#8217;t find. And you have autocompletion so there is no fear that you simply mistype something.</p>

<p><strong>Side effects</strong></p>

<p>Next step, let&#8217;s remove some of the side effects.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at homepages"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I entir my credential"</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">submitLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I can accass my wallet"</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">accountIsDisplayed</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now this is again much better. There are no steps left out. And you can test now the FillForm and the submit independently. Like, submitting the form without filling it out! Or filling it out and not submiting it. Reads better, is explicit, more easy to understand.</p>

<p>And the last one for today:</p>

<p><strong>Grammar</strong></p>

<p>I wonder if you noticed it&#8230; The grammar is a little bit off in the tests. A small mistake here and there. You might think that, who cares? That&#8217;s a very bad thought. I think the correct grammar reflects caring. It reflects that we thought about this test and that we thought about the quality of it. Because it means that after you wrote it, you actually re-read the test to make sure it&#8217;s understandable and readable.</p>

<p>So let us correct that:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"As a player I can log in to check my account."</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at the homepage"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I enter my log in credentials."</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">submitLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage

        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I'm directed to my account page."</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>

    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>I also took the liberty of re-phrasing some of the text so that it shows what the test is about and what the user really would like to achieve here. Now try reading that last one. Does it make more sense? Did you understand it at first go? Did it read like a good story?</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;d like to write a little bit about a python course I did.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an 8 week course on algorithmic programming with fun little projects. I&#8217;d like to write down some of my solutions with pseudo code for my own better understanding and for the sake of sharing knowledge. I won&#8217;t, however, share full projects since that would be against the honour code.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s begin&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Week Zero</strong></p>

<p>This week was all about getting the hang out of reading the posts and the documentation and the questions and getting used to the wordings. The tutors really out did themselves. They tried to make a course that can be both funny and teach something at the same time which is anything but easy.</p>

<p>Even though the tasks that were given were interesting al-bight at times a little bit far stretched and could have been easier done if used something else to complete them. But if we would have done that, what&#8217;s the point of it all then?</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll try to recall everything solely based on my notes taken in those 8 weeks. Let&#8217;s see how much I truly learned.</p>

<p><strong>Assignment of week one</strong></p>

<p>We were to build the game 2048 which if you played you know what it is all about.</p>

<div style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
  <img src="http://ironyca.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/2048-game.jpg?w=500&h=666" alt="" width="215" height="287" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    2048 Game
  </p>
</div>

<p>The goal is to add up numbers so that higher and higher numbers are created. There is no real &#8220;end&#8221; of the game. You can continue as long as you have space left although the intended goal is to create 2048. There are a couple of clones of this game and we were supposed to write one this time of our own.</p>

<p>We approached this game with the intention of refreshing our memory about Python. Handling matrices python syntax, counting indices and a bit of assessment about the general understanding of Mathematics and programming from the populace.</p>

<p>I must say it was hard. It was hard to get back into the habit of properly thinking about something at first. It was hard to get used to Math again which I missed for a very long time. I forgot many things and as English is not my first language many things written about Math in English were extremely hard to understand in the beginning.</p>

<p>But thankfully for my trusty mathematics Bible in Hungarian I was saved.</p>

<p>This book is 1448 pages long but contained all the information necessary to get my mind back into the game. And oh boy was it worth the initial trouble. I had to first realize that I forgot so much it was very painful and immensely disappointing, frustrating and shameful. But you should never give up and so I fought my way through it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And it was extremely helpful to do Tests First. As the grading was based on how many of a given set of Unit Tests were passing it was very helpful to start tests first which were leading the design of the program. Also it was crucial to work in as little chunks as possible since one could easily lost himself trying to grasp a problem proving to be too large to look at from afar.</p>

<p>The hard part about this project was the Merging of the numbers and creating the proper grid which results from the Merge. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[2, 0, 2, 4]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 4, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[0, 0, 2, 2]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 0, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[2, 2, 0, 0]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 0, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[2, 2, 2, 2]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 4, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[8, 16, 16, 8]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[8, 32, 8, 0]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In order to achieve this you must trim the zeros like this <span style="color: #ff0000;">[2,2,4]</span> and than produce the result which is <span style="color: #ff0000;">[4,4]</span> and put a couple of zeros at the end <span style="color: #ff0000;">[4,4,0,0]</span>. My first though was to use the Deque class in Python in order to achieve this but that was an outside module which was not allowed.</p>

<p>It was an interesting way to begin the course. Many people left at this point and were leaving afterwards too. Most of them in frustration that they were missing the python knowledge the rest out of frustration of not knowing the necessary math. At the end though it was getting easier to follow the problems after we got used to the conventions and sentence structures. The professors were also helpful and sometimes re-worded some of the descriptions to better describe what they wanted.</p>

<p><strong>Week One</strong></p>

<p>So after a hard start we moved on to a very interesting week one. This one got me into a certain game I don&#8217;t want to see ever again&#8230; It&#8217;s name: <strong><a title="Cookie Clicker" href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank">Cookie Clicker</a>.</strong></p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130827014912/cookieclicker/images/5/5a/PerfectCookie.png" alt="" width="203" height="203" /></p>

<p>We sort of had to re-create the cookie clicker but without the clicking. We only were supposed to re-create the buying of upgrades and simulate a sequence of clicks via the means of a cycle.</p>

<p>In this week the description of the tasks was, at the least, confusing. They started to use the term _time _which lead many to believe that we were somehow supposed to use python&#8217;s date / time methods and libraries. But after a couple of re-reads it was apparent that by _time <em>they actually were referring to </em><strong>cycle count.</strong>_<strong> </strong></p>

<p>Knowing this made the task at hand a lot easier. This time around our main focus were the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mathematical Sums</li>
<li>Finding the Max</li>
<li>Higher &#8211; Order functions</li>
<li>Plotting with Python</li>
</ul>

<p>The course just went into overdrive. We were looking a lot at thing like these:</p>

<p><span id="MathJax-Span-185" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-186" class="munderover"><span id="MathJax-Span-187" class="mo">∑</span><span id="MathJax-Span-193" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">n i=0 </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-194" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-195" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^</span><span id="MathJax-Span-196" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">i </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-197" class="mo">= </span><span id="MathJax-Span-198" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-199" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^</span><span id="MathJax-Span-200" class="mn">0 </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-201" class="mo">+ </span><span id="MathJax-Span-202" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-203" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^</span><span id="MathJax-Span-204" class="mn">1 </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-205" class="mo">+ </span><span id="MathJax-Span-206" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-207" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^</span><span id="MathJax-Span-208" class="mn">2 </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-209" class="mo">+ </span><span id="MathJax-Span-210" class="mo">.</span><span id="MathJax-Span-211" class="mo">.</span><span id="MathJax-Span-212" class="mo">. </span><span id="MathJax-Span-213" class="mo">+ </span><span id="MathJax-Span-214" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-215" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^</span><span id="MathJax-Span-216" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">n </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-217" class="mo">= </span><span id="MathJax-Span-218" class="mfrac"><span id="MathJax-Span-219" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-220" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-221" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^(</span><span id="MathJax-Span-222" class="texatom"><span id="MathJax-Span-223" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-224" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">n</span><span id="MathJax-Span-225" class="mo">+</span><span id="MathJax-Span-226" class="mn">1) </span></span></span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-227" class="mo">− </span><span id="MathJax-Span-228" class="mn">1 / </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-229" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-230" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α </span><span id="MathJax-Span-231" class="mo">− </span><span id="MathJax-Span-232" class="mn">1</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>It was rather awesome though frustrating at first like I wrote earlier. These were the easier one.</p>

<p>Finding the maximum is trivial. Especially if you are using a built in <strong>max </strong>provided by Python. But if you mix it with Higher-Order functions it gets interesting. If you want to do anything else as well and not just a max, for example getting the index of the maximum item as well, you usually end up writing a custom Max any ways.</p>

<p>Plotting in Python was exquisite interesting. The garphs which were produced showed as an insight into how powerful a solution really is or how effective. Here came in the Big-O notations almost. To see if a function was exponential, logarithmic or plain polynomial. O(n), O(n^2), O(logn) etc, etc.</p>

<p>This resulted in very interesting graphs like this:</p>

<p><strong>Week Two</strong></p>

<p>So last week we had plotting and counting this week was even more interesting. Week Two&#8217;s main focus was <strong>Probability</strong>. Specifically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank"><strong>Monte Carlo</strong> <strong>methods</strong></a>. Tl;dr; it describes that if you try something enough times you can derive a result that will be, with very high probability, the one you are looking for (expected value).</p>

<p>We tried out this algorithm by playing a nice game of tic-tac-toe.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.janetkruskamp.com/Images/TicTacToe.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="227" /></p>

<p>The point of this exercise was to create a machine player which, after running a 1000 or so random scenarios, was choosing the best option given a certain game state. It was difficult to get the results to always return a correct answer. At this point last weeks plotting became important since if your Monet Carlo algorithm was not fast enough the program was running increasingly slower and slower.</p>

<p>I was not very satisfied with my solution. It worked, but it was very slow and it wasn&#8217;t always returning the best option&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Week Three</strong></p>

<p>So what comes after probability? Correct. <strong>Combinatorics. </strong></p>

<p>The next hill to climb was combinatorics. Fortunately for me I love probability and combinatorics so this was a little bit easier for me. I was getting the hang out of function calculation as well so I wrote better homework and better projects at this point. Which is the aim of the course, right?</p>

<p>The game we used for this approach was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee" target="_blank"><strong>Yahtzee</strong></a>.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://playpop.com/medias/images/splashscreens/yahtzee_en.png" alt="" width="279" height="201" /></p>

<p>Now let me say this without too much remorse. I truly, fully and with all my heart, hate Yahtzee. I think it&#8217;s stupid. I&#8217;m sorry. I truly do. The only thing I can think of when I hear yahtzee is the South Park version of it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>South Park Version of Yahtzee + Tron:</p>

<p>I share the enthusiastic look of Stan here.</p>

<p>Anyhow, moving on&#8230; Thank to the coursera Gods we weren&#8217;t suppose to write a whole game of Yathzee just a very simplified version of it. We were supposed to count the upper combinations on the second throw. So you already have one throw and you must choose how many die you want to hold on to to maximise the possibility of the best outcome possible. Huh&#8230; come again?</p>

<p>So you already had a hand. And now the program was to determine which die you were supposed to hold on too in order to maximise the score you can achieve with the remaining two throws.</p>

<p>There were a few interesting things that came in with this task. For example this was the first time I could use a Dict init from a list with a zip.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;">hand_dict <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> <span style="color: #008000;">dict</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">zip</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">list</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span>hand<span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span><span style="color: #ff4500;"></span><span style="color: black;">&#93;</span>*<span style="color: #008000;">len</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span>hand<span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>And this was the point in course were I found perhaps the most interesting thing. I found an actual use for reduce which was working. I was beginning to get into the habit of using map, filter, reduce.</p>

<p>This was the beauty:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;">my_list <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> <span style="color: #008000;">reduce</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">lambda</span> z<span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> x: z + <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span>y + <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span>x<span style="color: black;">&#93;</span> <span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">for</span> y <span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">in</span> z<span style="color: black;">&#93;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> hand<span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span><span style="color: black;">&#91;</span><span style="color: black;">&#93;</span><span style="color: black;">&#93;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This piece of code produced all the combinations of a given hand which was a list of Tuples. It merged them into a list of lists which I created a list of Tuples out from. After this my life was never ever the same again.</p>

<p><strong>Week Four</strong></p>

<p>For me this was the most interesting part of the course. I LOVED this task. Focus was:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python Generators</li>
<li>Stacks / Queues</li>
<li>Inheritance in Python</li>
<li>Girds</li>
<li>Grid Search / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search" target="_blank">Breadth First Search</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And the task with which we were supposed to achieve this was&#8230;. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Zombie Apocalypse</strong></span>. It was sort of like <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway&#8217;s Game of Life</a></strong>. Given a grid in which there were <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Zombies</strong></span><strong> </strong>and <span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Humans </span></strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Obstacles.</span></strong></p>

<p>The Zombies could only move up, down, left, right. The humans could flee diagonally and none of them could penetrate an obstacle. It was very much fun to write this. The most challenge was to learn the proper implementation of the breadth first search algorithm as the Zombies had to detect the nearest Humans to move towards to and the Humans needed to see the nearest Zombies to flee from.</p>

<p><strong>Week Five</strong></p>

<p>Halfway through it was become difficult to maintain the time needed for this course. I was finding myself applying a few late days here and there. This was a two months course after all. I did not have all the time in the world at my disposal. But I managed to submit everything without penalties.</p>

<p>So this weeks task was rather mundane. It was a <strong>world wrangler</strong>. Which means given a word generate valid words from the letters in the provided word.</p>

<p>The algorithm we were supposed to use though was for me a bit of a challenge. I&#8217;ll be honest with you, for me, it was a little bit hard to wrap my head around this one. But eventually I succeeded.</p>

<p>It was Merge-Sort and Recursion. Let me tell you this now, I hate merge-sort. Recursion I do love though. What I never learned though and was very interesting for me to learn now was recurrences in mathematics. Well never learned is a bit harsh since I knew Fibonacci already and Pascal&#8217;s Triangle but the mathematical definition was a refreshing new view. I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation" target="_blank"><strong>Recurrence Relations</strong></a>.</p>

<p><img class="mwe-math-fallback-png-inline tex" style="color: #252525;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/a/4/1a4da05124f61db47a4805b411ff8c3b.png" alt="F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}" /></p>

<p>This is the Recurrence relation of the famous Fibonacci. Easy, right? Well the hard part is when you are trying to get the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binet_formula#Closed-form_expression" target="_blank"><strong>closed-form-expression</strong></a> of a Recurrence.</p>

<p><strong>Week Six</strong></p>

<p>Finally it was coming to an end. The last week was easy so this week had to have a punch. And oh boy it did. This weeks focus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trees</li>
<li>Lambdas</li>
<li>Illustration of Trees</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" target="_blank">Minimax</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search" target="_blank">Depth First Search</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If I hated merge-sort I hated minimax more. I don&#8217;t know why but it was again very hard for me to properly grasp this concept. I mean I understood what needed to be done of course but writing it done with code proved to be more difficult then I thought it would be.</p>

<p>After hours of research and reading finally I could come up with a solution which was working. I wouldn&#8217;t say it was good&#8230; But it was working.</p>

<p>The game with which we were supposed to demonstrate this algorithm was&#8230; Tic-Tac-Toe. Turns out that it&#8217;s rather common place to show off minimax with tic-tac-toe as it was fewer possibilities. The point of the exercise was the following&#8230;:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yosenl/extras/alphabeta/alphabeta.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="405" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To create trees out of the possible moves given a certain game state. This time we wanted to make absolutely sure that if we can&#8217;t win the game at least we won&#8217;t loose it. And that&#8217;s the point of minimax. It will minimize your losses.</p>

<p>Now there are several things about this algorithm that are hard.</p>

<p><strong>Performance of Minimax</strong></p>

<p>It has and always will be a very interesting task for programmers to try to achieve a better performance for these calculations. Since it&#8217;s trying to build up a tree with all the possible combinations a game can have it will end up with a huge tree which will take ages to traverse.</p>

<p>A few of the solutions could be to exit the search once you have a definitive answer. If you find a winning move there is no point of looking any further. You just stop.</p>

<p>You can create the tree dynamically. You can make it somehow intelligent enough to predict a possible best first move and then use minimax on the rest. Or use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning" target="_blank"><strong>Alpha-beta pruning</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Week Seven</strong></p>

<p>And so we are coming to an end. Last weeks assignment was basically to put all the previous weeks knowledge together to create the application called 15 puzzle.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://kociemba.org/fifteen/pics/puz.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="183" /></p>

<p>Now, there was however a little addition to the previous knowledge. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(computer_science)" target="_blank"><strong>invariants</strong></a>. Now, I love Logic. And I&#8217;ve been actually using invariants in computer science programming and testing for a long time so this part was not really a problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An example of an invariant in python would be something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">while</span> x &lt<span style="color: #66cc66;">;=</span> <span style="color: #ff4500;">5</span>:
  x <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> x + <span style="color: #ff4500;">1</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This is a loop invariant example. In you find a very useful invariant in your program you can write an assert for it which will help you debug your code and work in small chunks. Invariants will make refactoring your code a hell of a lot easier. As if your invariant is suddenly false you need to check what went wrong.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">while</span> x &lt<span style="color: #66cc66;">;=</span> <span style="color: #ff4500;">5</span>:
  x <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> x + <span style="color: #ff4500;">1</span>
  <span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">assert</span> x &lt<span style="color: #66cc66;">;=</span> <span style="color: #ff4500;">6</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This assert will make sure that if your invariant for whatever reason isn&#8217;t true your code fails immediately.</p>

<p><strong>End Credits</strong></p>

<p>So this was the end of the course. I learned a a lot from this course and I&#8217;m very proud of myself for completing it. I took away a lot from this course. I took away confidence and logical thinking. I took away greater trust in my Python knowledge and that it&#8217;s very important to keep my skills from deteriorating.</p>

<p>And I think math is important for proper, deep understanding of programming as a science. I think refreshing my math skills gave me at least a deeper trust in my ability to write a piece of code however complicated it might appear. After writing a minimax algorithm I think some Hibernate with DIP and SRP will prove to be less of a problem. Or at least a different category of a problem&#8230;. Hehe.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;d like to write a little bit about a python course I did.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an 8 week course on algorithmic programming with fun little projects. I&#8217;d like to write down some of my solutions with pseudo code for my own better understanding and for the sake of sharing knowledge. I won&#8217;t, however, share full projects since that would be against the honour code.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s begin&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Week Zero</strong></p>

<p>This week was all about getting the hang out of reading the posts and the documentation and the questions and getting used to the wordings. The tutors really out did themselves. They tried to make a course that can be both funny and teach something at the same time which is anything but easy.</p>

<p>Even though the tasks that were given were interesting al-bight at times a little bit far stretched and could have been easier done if used something else to complete them. But if we would have done that, what&#8217;s the point of it all then?</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll try to recall everything solely based on my notes taken in those 8 weeks. Let&#8217;s see how much I truly learned.</p>

<p><strong>Assignment of week one</strong></p>

<p>We were to build the game 2048 which if you played you know what it is all about.</p>

<div style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
  <img src="http://ironyca.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/2048-game.jpg?w=500&h=666" alt="" width="215" height="287" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    2048 Game
  </p>
</div>

<p>The goal is to add up numbers so that higher and higher numbers are created. There is no real &#8220;end&#8221; of the game. You can continue as long as you have space left although the intended goal is to create 2048. There are a couple of clones of this game and we were supposed to write one this time of our own.</p>

<p>We approached this game with the intention of refreshing our memory about Python. Handling matrices python syntax, counting indices and a bit of assessment about the general understanding of Mathematics and programming from the populace.</p>

<p>I must say it was hard. It was hard to get back into the habit of properly thinking about something at first. It was hard to get used to Math again which I missed for a very long time. I forgot many things and as English is not my first language many things written about Math in English were extremely hard to understand in the beginning.</p>

<p>But thankfully for my trusty mathematics Bible in Hungarian I was saved.</p>

    Math book
  </p>
</div>

<p>This book is 1448 pages long but contained all the information necessary to get my mind back into the game. And oh boy was it worth the initial trouble. I had to first realize that I forgot so much it was very painful and immensely disappointing, frustrating and shameful. But you should never give up and so I fought my way through it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And it was extremely helpful to do Tests First. As the grading was based on how many of a given set of Unit Tests were passing it was very helpful to start tests first which were leading the design of the program. Also it was crucial to work in as little chunks as possible since one could easily lost himself trying to grasp a problem proving to be too large to look at from afar.</p>

<p>The hard part about this project was the Merging of the numbers and creating the proper grid which results from the Merge. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[2, 0, 2, 4]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 4, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[0, 0, 2, 2]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 0, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[2, 2, 0, 0]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 0, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[2, 2, 2, 2]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 4, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[8, 16, 16, 8]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[8, 32, 8, 0]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In order to achieve this you must trim the zeros like this <span style="color: #ff0000;">[2,2,4]</span> and than produce the result which is <span style="color: #ff0000;">[4,4]</span> and put a couple of zeros at the end <span style="color: #ff0000;">[4,4,0,0]</span>. My first though was to use the Deque class in Python in order to achieve this but that was an outside module which was not allowed.</p>

<p>It was an interesting way to begin the course. Many people left at this point and were leaving afterwards too. Most of them in frustration that they were missing the python knowledge the rest out of frustration of not knowing the necessary math. At the end though it was getting easier to follow the problems after we got used to the conventions and sentence structures. The professors were also helpful and sometimes re-worded some of the descriptions to better describe what they wanted.</p>

<p><strong>Week One</strong></p>

<p>So after a hard start we moved on to a very interesting week one. This one got me into a certain game I don&#8217;t want to see ever again&#8230; It&#8217;s name: <strong><a title="Cookie Clicker" href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank">Cookie Clicker</a>.</strong></p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130827014912/cookieclicker/images/5/5a/PerfectCookie.png" alt="" width="203" height="203" /></p>

<p>We sort of had to re-create the cookie clicker but without the clicking. We only were supposed to re-create the buying of upgrades and simulate a sequence of clicks via the means of a cycle.</p>

<p>In this week the description of the tasks was, at the least, confusing. They started to use the term _time _which lead many to believe that we were somehow supposed to use python&#8217;s date / time methods and libraries. But after a couple of re-reads it was apparent that by _time <em>they actually were referring to </em><strong>cycle count.</strong>_<strong> </strong></p>

<p>Knowing this made the task at hand a lot easier. This time around our main focus were the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mathematical Sums</li>
<li>Finding the Max</li>
<li>Higher &#8211; Order functions</li>
<li>Plotting with Python</li>
</ul>

<p>The course just went into overdrive. We were looking a lot at thing like these:</p>

<p>It was rather awesome though frustrating at first like I wrote earlier. These were the easier one.</p>

<p>Finding the maximum is trivial. Especially if you are using a built in <strong>max </strong>provided by Python. But if you mix it with Higher-Order functions it gets interesting. If you want to do anything else as well and not just a max, for example getting the index of the maximum item as well, you usually end up writing a custom Max any ways.</p>

<p>Plotting in Python was exquisite interesting. The garphs which were produced showed as an insight into how powerful a solution really is or how effective. Here came in the Big-O notations almost. To see if a function was exponential, logarithmic or plain polynomial. O(n), O(n^2), O(logn) etc, etc.</p>

<p>This resulted in very interesting graphs like this:</p>

<p><strong>Week Two</strong></p>

<p>So last week we had plotting and counting this week was even more interesting. Week Two&#8217;s main focus was <strong>Probability</strong>. Specifically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank"><strong>Monte Carlo</strong> <strong>methods</strong></a>. Tl;dr; it describes that if you try something enough times you can derive a result that will be, with very high probability, the one you are looking for (expected value).</p>

<p>We tried out this algorithm by playing a nice game of tic-tac-toe.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.janetkruskamp.com/Images/TicTacToe.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="227" /></p>

<p>The point of this exercise was to create a machine player which, after running a 1000 or so random scenarios, was choosing the best option given a certain game state. It was difficult to get the results to always return a correct answer. At this point last weeks plotting became important since if your Monet Carlo algorithm was not fast enough the program was running increasingly slower and slower.</p>

<p>I was not very satisfied with my solution. It worked, but it was very slow and it wasn&#8217;t always returning the best option&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Week Three</strong></p>

<p>So what comes after probability? Correct. <strong>Combinatorics. </strong></p>

<p>The next hill to climb was combinatorics. Fortunately for me I love probability and combinatorics so this was a little bit easier for me. I was getting the hang out of function calculation as well so I wrote better homework and better projects at this point. Which is the aim of the course, right?</p>

<p>The game we used for this approach was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee" target="_blank"><strong>Yahtzee</strong></a>.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://playpop.com/medias/images/splashscreens/yahtzee_en.png" alt="" width="279" height="201" /></p>

<p>Now let me say this without too much remorse. I truly, fully and with all my heart, hate Yahtzee. I think it&#8217;s stupid. I&#8217;m sorry. I truly do. The only thing I can think of when I hear yahtzee is the South Park version of it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>South Park Version of Yahtzee + Tron:</p>

<p>I share the enthusiastic look of Stan here.</p>

<p>Anyhow, moving on&#8230; Thank to the coursera Gods we weren&#8217;t suppose to write a whole game of Yathzee just a very simplified version of it. We were supposed to count the upper combinations on the second throw. So you already have one throw and you must choose how many die you want to hold on to to maximise the possibility of the best outcome possible. Huh&#8230; come again?</p>

<p>So you already had a hand. And now the program was to determine which die you were supposed to hold on too in order to maximise the score you can achieve with the remaining two throws.</p>

<p>There were a few interesting things that came in with this task. For example this was the first time I could use a Dict init from a list with a zip.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;">hand_dict <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> <span style="color: #008000;">dict</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">zip</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">list</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span>hand<span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span><span style="color: #ff4500;"></span><span style="color: black;">&#93;</span>*<span style="color: #008000;">len</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span>hand<span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>And this was the point in course were I found perhaps the most interesting thing. I found an actual use for reduce which was working. I was beginning to get into the habit of using map, filter, reduce.</p>

<p>This was the beauty:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;">my_list <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> <span style="color: #008000;">reduce</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">lambda</span> z<span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> x: z + <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span>y + <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span>x<span style="color: black;">&#93;</span> <span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">for</span> y <span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">in</span> z<span style="color: black;">&#93;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> hand<span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span><span style="color: black;">&#91;</span><span style="color: black;">&#93;</span><span style="color: black;">&#93;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This piece of code produced all the combinations of a given hand which was a list of Tuples. It merged them into a list of lists which I created a list of Tuples out from. After this my life was never ever the same again.</p>

<p><strong>Week Four</strong></p>

<p>For me this was the most interesting part of the course. I LOVED this task. Focus was:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python Generators</li>
<li>Stacks / Queues</li>
<li>Inheritance in Python</li>
<li>Girds</li>
<li>Grid Search / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search" target="_blank">Breadth First Search</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And the task with which we were supposed to achieve this was&#8230;. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Zombie Apocalypse</strong></span>. It was sort of like <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway&#8217;s Game of Life</a></strong>. Given a grid in which there were <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Zombies</strong></span><strong> </strong>and <span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Humans </span></strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Obstacles.</span></strong></p>

<p>The Zombies could only move up, down, left, right. The humans could flee diagonally and none of them could penetrate an obstacle. It was very much fun to write this. The most challenge was to learn the proper implementation of the breadth first search algorithm as the Zombies had to detect the nearest Humans to move towards to and the Humans needed to see the nearest Zombies to flee from.</p>

<p><strong>Week Five</strong></p>

<p>Halfway through it was become difficult to maintain the time needed for this course. I was finding myself applying a few late days here and there. This was a two months course after all. I did not have all the time in the world at my disposal. But I managed to submit everything without penalties.</p>

<p>So this weeks task was rather mundane. It was a <strong>world wrangler</strong>. Which means given a word generate valid words from the letters in the provided word.</p>

<p>The algorithm we were supposed to use though was for me a bit of a challenge. I&#8217;ll be honest with you, for me, it was a little bit hard to wrap my head around this one. But eventually I succeeded.</p>

<p>It was Merge-Sort and Recursion. Let me tell you this now, I hate merge-sort. Recursion I do love though. What I never learned though and was very interesting for me to learn now was recurrences in mathematics. Well never learned is a bit harsh since I knew Fibonacci already and Pascal&#8217;s Triangle but the mathematical definition was a refreshing new view. I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation" target="_blank"><strong>Recurrence Relations</strong></a>.</p>

<p><img class="mwe-math-fallback-png-inline tex" style="color: #252525;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/a/4/1a4da05124f61db47a4805b411ff8c3b.png" alt="F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}" /></p>

<p>This is the Recurrence relation of the famous Fibonacci. Easy, right? Well the hard part is when you are trying to get the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binet_formula#Closed-form_expression" target="_blank"><strong>closed-form-expression</strong></a> of a Recurrence.</p>

<p><strong>Week Six</strong></p>

<p>Finally it was coming to an end. The last week was easy so this week had to have a punch. And oh boy it did. This weeks focus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trees</li>
<li>Lambdas</li>
<li>Illustration of Trees</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" target="_blank">Minimax</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search" target="_blank">Depth First Search</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If I hated merge-sort I hated minimax more. I don&#8217;t know why but it was again very hard for me to properly grasp this concept. I mean I understood what needed to be done of course but writing it done with code proved to be more difficult then I thought it would be.</p>

<p>After hours of research and reading finally I could come up with a solution which was working. I wouldn&#8217;t say it was good&#8230; But it was working.</p>

<p>The game with which we were supposed to demonstrate this algorithm was&#8230; Tic-Tac-Toe. Turns out that it&#8217;s rather common place to show off minimax with tic-tac-toe as it was fewer possibilities. The point of the exercise was the following&#8230;:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yosenl/extras/alphabeta/alphabeta.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="405" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To create trees out of the possible moves given a certain game state. This time we wanted to make absolutely sure that if we can&#8217;t win the game at least we won&#8217;t loose it. And that&#8217;s the point of minimax. It will minimize your losses.</p>

<p>Now there are several things about this algorithm that are hard.</p>

<p><strong>Performance of Minimax</strong></p>

<p>It has and always will be a very interesting task for programmers to try to achieve a better performance for these calculations. Since it&#8217;s trying to build up a tree with all the possible combinations a game can have it will end up with a huge tree which will take ages to traverse.</p>

<p>A few of the solutions could be to exit the search once you have a definitive answer. If you find a winning move there is no point of looking any further. You just stop.</p>

<p>You can create the tree dynamically. You can make it somehow intelligent enough to predict a possible best first move and then use minimax on the rest. Or use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning" target="_blank"><strong>Alpha-beta pruning</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Week Seven</strong></p>

<p>And so we are coming to an end. Last weeks assignment was basically to put all the previous weeks knowledge together to create the application called 15 puzzle.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://kociemba.org/fifteen/pics/puz.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="183" /></p>

<p>Now, there was however a little addition to the previous knowledge. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(computer_science)" target="_blank"><strong>invariants</strong></a>. Now, I love Logic. And I&#8217;ve been actually using invariants in computer science programming and testing for a long time so this part was not really a problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An example of an invariant in python would be something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">while</span> x &lt<span style="color: #66cc66;">;=</span> <span style="color: #ff4500;">5</span>:
  x <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> x + <span style="color: #ff4500;">1</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This is a loop invariant example. In you find a very useful invariant in your program you can write an assert for it which will help you debug your code and work in small chunks. Invariants will make refactoring your code a hell of a lot easier. As if your invariant is suddenly false you need to check what went wrong.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">while</span> x &lt<span style="color: #66cc66;">;=</span> <span style="color: #ff4500;">5</span>:
  x <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> x + <span style="color: #ff4500;">1</span>
  <span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">assert</span> x &lt<span style="color: #66cc66;">;=</span> <span style="color: #ff4500;">6</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This assert will make sure that if your invariant for whatever reason isn&#8217;t true your code fails immediately.</p>

<p><strong>End Credits</strong></p>

<p>So this was the end of the course. I learned a a lot from this course and I&#8217;m very proud of myself for completing it. I took away a lot from this course. I took away confidence and logical thinking. I took away greater trust in my Python knowledge and that it&#8217;s very important to keep my skills from deteriorating.</p>

<p>And I think math is important for proper, deep understanding of programming as a science. I think refreshing my math skills gave me at least a deeper trust in my ability to write a piece of code however complicated it might appear. After writing a minimax algorithm I think some Hibernate with DIP and SRP will prove to be less of a problem. Or at least a different category of a problem&#8230;. Hehe.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!
