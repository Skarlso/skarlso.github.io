                        <p>Hello Folks.</p>

<p>So last I was writing about why a tester should learn Javascript. Today I would like to write about why a tester should learn SQL.</p>

<p>There, I said it. I know many people, especially testers, don&#8217;t like SQL. They view it as a monster best be avoided. Something only Database people will know. Something which is so scary and ugly, nobody really wants it.</p>

<p>But I will give you a couple of good reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of SQL. And why you should welcome it as your best friend and partner in crime.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number One: Data gathering</strong></p>

<p>This one is obvious and clear as the sun. You can use simple queries to mine for data. To look up changes and compare time intervals between insertion and update events. You can monitor certain tables so that when they are updated, you&#8217;ll get a red flag.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number Two: Test Run Statistics</strong></p>

<p>This one is from my friend Adrian. Basically if you would like to know more about what&#8217;s happening with your tests when they run, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run time</li>
<li>Frequency of Test outcome</li>
<li>Failure rate</li>
<li>Environment details -&gt; Execution slave</li>
</ul>

<p>One interesting way to achieve this is, to have the test report running and outcomes into a little mysql database and than create queries of certain types like, show me the last run of every test called xyz and show me the environmental details and the run time. With this closely monitored you could find out that Slave #345 is sluggish because each time the test ran on it, it took more then 10 minutes where as the others only took 5-6.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number Three: Data Manipulation</strong></p>

<p>So after monitoring comes naturally the edit. Understanding how databases work and knowing a few queries here and there can help you manipulating your data in a way that it will be easier to test data dependant scenarios.</p>

<p>Instead of making a new entry you could edit what you already have.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>You have a customer and you want to test the system&#8217;s ability to handle people on your site who are suspended from access. But the ability to suspend is not yet working. Will that stop you from testing this feature? Will you put this feature into blocked because: &#8220;Ohh, we can&#8217;t yet suspend a player so we need to wait until that&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>

<p>No. You don&#8217;t wait. You dig into your database, find the necessary record, change it&#8217;s state to the desired state; even if it has a foreign key which needs to be updated or that status doesn&#8217;t exist yet, in which case you ADD it to the list of states yourself. You don&#8217;t let yourself be stopped just because something is not done yet. You move on by being clever.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number Four: Understanding Data migration issues</strong></p>

<p>A big issue these days if you go into a project where you have a previous version of what you are currently building will be migrating over old data into the new database scheme. Testing such a thing can be a pain in the butt. But it will be a LOT easier if you understand the changes. If you know what changed, how and why, you can manipulate your data in order to fit the new scheme. Or if you need to test it you won&#8217;t be afraid of running some stored procedures in a dummy database with old data and than run a few queries to see what broke and what didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Do you have a foreign key violation somewhere when you migrated over and have no idea what do to? Time to learn some SQL so that you don&#8217;t have to run to somebody every time you encounter it. Even if you can&#8217;t fix it, the database engineers or the devs who will fix the bug will be very happy that you provided as much information as possible in your report.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number Five: Security</strong></p>

<p>SQL Injection is still at large. Even with these days frameworks doing full escapes it can&#8217;t hurt to test a couple just to be on the safe side. And writing a clever script that mines for accessible tables here and there is an essential skill in a security tester&#8217;s repertoire.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Bonus: Performance, HibernateQL, Information</strong></p>

<p>Lastly a bit of a bonus are these three.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

<p>Suppose you are running a web application. You access a large list and you notice that it&#8217;s sort of sluggish. You first blame it on the network so you test it locally. It seems to be better now so you move on but it leaves a little voice in your head so you can&#8217;t abandon it. You go back and try locally again with a bit more data in your database.</p>

<p>You notice it&#8217;s a little bit better but it&#8217;s still somehow sluggish. Suddenly you get a hunch and turn on SQL logging in your tomcat instance. You click the link again and wait with eyes wide open on what happens next. It&#8217;s your worst nightmare.</p>

<p>The SQL queries the whole database with a simple select and than filters the data on the front-end side. Which is a really really dumb thing to do. So you file a bug for which the title is something similar to this: &#8220;Customer Transaction History query doesn&#8217;t apply WHERE | INNER SELECT | PAGING on SQL rather it filters on the application layer.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>HibernateQL</strong></p>

<p>This is the SQL language of hibernate which is the underlying technology in many java web frameworks these days. It uses it&#8217;s own thing called <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en/html/queryhql.html" target="_blank">HQL</a>. Main difference, as this page already says, is that it&#8217;s a full blown Object Oriented query language which understand inheritance and polymorphism which is very exciting.</p>

<p><strong>Information</strong></p>

<p>Last but not least I mentioned this one earlier. You can provide more information in your bug reports as in what data you used, where was it happening, what was the last update date, which environment and what query was executed ( if you have query debugging turned on ). Whoever reads that bug report will find it very helpful that you provided enough information to reproduce it anywhere.</p>

<p>Because many times the culprit for a bug is the underlying data.</p>

<p><strong>Reading and Practising resources</strong></p>

<p>Here is a very awesome picture of how to understand JOINS which is everybody&#8217;s fear.</p>

<p>And a post on <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/" target="_blank">Coding Horror</a> which is essentially the same but I like how Jeff writes.</p>

<p>Also if you would like to practice writing SQL scripts and no longer be afraid of them all the rest of your life go to this site =&gt; <a href="http://sqlzoo.net/" target="_blank">SQLZoo</a>. It&#8217;s an interactive way of trying out your SQL skills and testing them on very clever database structures.</p>

<p>But if you, like me, love to learn PLAYING than THIS is the place for you =&gt; <a href="https://schemaverse.com/" target="_blank">The Schemaverse</a>. It&#8217;s a SQL based space shooting strategy game awesomeness! Have FUN learning SQL.</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Is TDD dead?</p>

<p>Not really. So let&#8217;s talk about this topic for a little bit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you already read a gazillion posts about this debate but frankly I&#8217;m writing this for myself, to rant a little bit, you know&#8230; Because somebody is wrong on the internet and I must intervene.</p>

<p>So first of all, the hashtag #tddisdead (and I will use it shamelessly as well). This is clearly an attempt to get as many peoples attention as you can. TDD is NOT DEAD. Obviously since it has soooo many supporters how could it be dead? It&#8217;s like asking, is Design Patterns dead? Or is Functional Automation dead? Or is Oreo cookies dead?</p>

<p>No, it&#8217;s not dead. And it won&#8217;t ever be dead. It will maybe change into something new, something better even, but it will never be dead. So let&#8217;s skip that part.</p>

<p>Now, about the <strong>debate</strong>.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t hear so much bull spoken for this long since I watched the political debate of two fractions in my home country. The right wing extremists against the left wing&#8230;. I don&#8217;t know whats. And it was just that. A political debate. It had no merit and no value whatsoever. At all. Nothing.</p>

<p>And right in the middle <strong>DHH</strong> says this:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;you&#8217;re not done until you also have tests for a piece of functionality &#8212; I&#8217;m completely on board with that.&#8221;.</em></p>

<p>That made the whole conversation completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>Every counter against TDD I heard was <strong>bull</strong>. Not in that debate, in general. People are either too lazy to write them, just don&#8217;t want to get out of their comfort zone, don&#8217;t really care about tests, or don&#8217;t really care about quality or under time pressure ( I get to this later. ).</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<p><strong>Quality</strong></p>

<p>People seem to not care about quality that much. Would they, they would understand that having a bulletproof west will save your life when you get shot in the chest with a 357 magnum. You can flush out early design flaws you can detect early bugs and do a better system design.</p>

<p>Sure if you are the most intelligent man on the planet maybe you can come up with a perfect system on the first draft and then implement it flawlessly so that it doesn&#8217;t fall apart in two months time. But most people can&#8217;t. Most people make errors on the way.</p>

<p>And yes, writing tests can be hard. But guess what? If writing a test is hard because that part of the system is complicated, than it will be that part of the system which will react the worst to change. And only change is constant. Which brings me to the next item&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Time constraints</strong></p>

<p>So your manager is sitting right next to you and saying come on we are paying you to write code and not tests so do it! And you have to have a feature done today but if you write a suite of tests you&#8217;ll only finish tomorrow. Sure, your estimate at that point will become a very quick one because you make a sacrifice of trust.</p>

<p>And then the next story comes along and you say&#8230; <em>&#8220;Sure I can do that as well. No problem I know how my system works, right? Hmm&#8230; why the hell did that break all of a sudden? I didn&#8217;t change anything in that module&#8230; Ahh damn it I said I&#8217;ll be done today, so let&#8217;s just fix this quickly and then move on to the next card.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>You get my drift. And suddenly you end up with estimates of <strong>WEEKS</strong>!!!! instead of days / hours for a simple story.</p>

<p><strong>Finishing it up</strong></p>

<p>This a rant only. It&#8217;s my personal opinion, experience and observation of a 10 year time period in Software Testing. Starting with at least a Weak Skeleton and a few upfront tests will help you in the long run. Writing at least ONE &#8211; TWO acceptance tests WILL help you understand business logic better. Writing ONE or TWO unit tests will help you understand your logic better. I&#8217;m not saying write a whole damn suite of tests I can understand you don&#8217;t want to do that, but for quality&#8217;s sake write at least a couple.</p>

<p>You will love it, I promise you that.</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Is TDD dead?</p>

<p>Not really. So let&#8217;s talk about this topic for a little bit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you already read a gazillion posts about this debate but frankly I&#8217;m writing this for myself, to rant a little bit, you know&#8230; Because somebody is wrong on the internet and I must intervene.</p>

<p>So first of all, the hashtag #tddisdead (and I will use it shamelessly as well). This is clearly an attempt to get as many peoples attention as you can. TDD is NOT DEAD. Obviously since it has soooo many supporters how could it be dead? It&#8217;s like asking, is Design Patterns dead? Or is Functional Automation dead? Or is Oreo cookies dead?</p>

<p>No, it&#8217;s not dead. And it won&#8217;t ever be dead. It will maybe change into something new, something better even, but it will never be dead. So let&#8217;s skip that part.</p>

<p>Now, about the <strong>debate</strong>.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t hear so much bull spoken for this long since I watched the political debate of two fractions in my home country. The right wing extremists against the left wing&#8230;. I don&#8217;t know whats. And it was just that. A political debate. It had no merit and no value whatsoever. At all. Nothing.</p>

<p>And right in the middle <strong>DHH</strong> says this:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;you&#8217;re not done until you also have tests for a piece of functionality &#8212; I&#8217;m completely on board with that.&#8221;.</em></p>

<p>That made the whole conversation completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>Every counter against TDD I heard was <strong>bull</strong>. Not in that debate, in general. People are either too lazy to write them, just don&#8217;t want to get out of their comfort zone, don&#8217;t really care about tests, or don&#8217;t really care about quality or under time pressure ( I get to this later. ).</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<p><strong>Quality</strong></p>

<p>People seem to not care about quality that much. Would they, they would understand that having a bulletproof west will save your life when you get shot in the chest with a 357 magnum. You can flush out early design flaws you can detect early bugs and do a better system design.</p>

<p>Sure if you are the most intelligent man on the planet maybe you can come up with a perfect system on the first draft and then implement it flawlessly so that it doesn&#8217;t fall apart in two months time. But most people can&#8217;t. Most people make errors on the way.</p>

<p>And yes, writing tests can be hard. But guess what? If writing a test is hard because that part of the system is complicated, than it will be that part of the system which will react the worst to change. And only change is constant. Which brings me to the next item&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Time constraints</strong></p>

<p>So your manager is sitting right next to you and saying come on we are paying you to write code and not tests so do it! And you have to have a feature done today but if you write a suite of tests you&#8217;ll only finish tomorrow. Sure, your estimate at that point will become a very quick one because you make a sacrifice of trust.</p>

<p>And then the next story comes along and you say&#8230; <em>&#8220;Sure I can do that as well. No problem I know how my system works, right? Hmm&#8230; why the hell did that break all of a sudden? I didn&#8217;t change anything in that module&#8230; Ahh damn it I said I&#8217;ll be done today, so let&#8217;s just fix this quickly and then move on to the next card.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>And the next story comes along&#8230; <em>&#8220;Sure I can do that&#8230; wait a minute&#8230; Didn&#8217;t that part brake already twice? Damn, better refactor. Ohh shit, why is that now breaking???? Damn it I said I&#8217;ll be done tomorrow, better patch it, and then move on. Hmm let&#8217;s write a test here to make sure this does not break. Ohhh damn I need PowerMock for that stuff since it&#8217;s in another module. Why the hell is that there? Should it be here in the first place since it&#8217;s somehow used by that other class there?

PowerMock is not allowed?? What?? Who the f*ck says that?&#8221;</em></p>

<p>You get my drift. And suddenly you end up with estimates of <strong>WEEKS</strong>!!!! instead of days / hours for a simple story.</p>

<p><strong>Finishing it up</strong></p>

<p>This a rant only. It&#8217;s my personal opinion, experience and observation of a 10 year time period in Software Testing.

                        <p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>Today I would like to write about a very interesting topic, I hope. So let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<p>As the title already suggests, I&#8217;m writing about why a front-end tester should learn at least a little bit about JavaScripting and the DOM.</p>

<p>Ohhh and contrary to the belief CSP ( Content Security Policy ) will <strong>not</strong> be the death of such scripts. There are white-lists and workarounds and exclusions which can be implemented in order to allow local JavaScripting to continue. So don&#8217;t fret&#8230; Read on.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 1: Injection</strong></p>

<p>Every front-ender tester has a waste amount of tools at their disposal. Various things, like Firebug and web developer Toolbar and&#8230; Bookmarklets and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/" target="_blank">Greasemonkey</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en" target="_blank">Tampermonkey</a>. These are the real powerful tools though. Your main objective at this point would be to inject something into your current site.</p>

<p>Suppose a scenario where you are testing something and you have an API at your disposal for a quick edit on a customer, like closing his account or giving him money, or doing something with his appliances. Suppose you don&#8217;t want to always switch away to another tab or call a service with certain parameters or go to a rest client and initiate that from there.</p>

<p>Suppose you could have a small injected DIV right on the page you are which gathers information for you, like the customer&#8217;s username, and wallet and whatnot, and with a simple press of a button, you just closed their account. Neat, isn&#8217;t it? Simple, fast, very comfortable with just one press of a button.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a DIV at the corner of a page, or even a drag and drop enabled one which you can drag around, with an arsenal of these buttons RIGHT THERE on your page. You don&#8217;t have to switch context at all.</p>

<p>These days it&#8217;s especially easy with tools like jQuery at your disposal. You just inject jQuery first, if the site is not already using it, and you are good to go and do whatever you like to do&#8230;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 2: Data gathering</strong></p>

<p>While we are testing these application we always create some kind of a report. That report contains many things about the customer, or it&#8217;s appliances or the things he does, does not. All these could be constantly gathered by your script as it runs in the background. It gathers statistics and information which otherwise you would have to gather from some transaction history, or some kind of an action history. But no&#8230; Not the JavaScript Wizard.</p>

<p>You, would just press a button and the script would generate a report for you. It would even print it out. Create a persistent layer in which you are gathering information continuously. Create a small mySql database on your local machine and have the JavaScript enter data into that. Tadaaam&#8230;. Usage statistics at the touch of a button. All there, only waiting to be extracted.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 3: Tempering</strong></p>

<p>In understanding the ways of the DOM and the JavaScript you can create some very interesting test cases not to mention XSS attacks which is essentially JavaScript Injection. That&#8217;s always fun and produces many very good bugs.</p>

<p>Cookie manipulation. You want to simulate something? Like a time-out or a session loss or anything like that with a push of a button? Easy&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 4: Shortcuts</strong></p>

<p>You have a massive field like registration that you need to fill out? The shortest way is to have an API which you can call via a curl script. But if that&#8217;s not available and you would like to exercise the front-end any ways, then you will end up wasting hours and hours on always filling out all of those pesky fields.</p>

<p>And suddenly I&#8217;m hearing: &#8220;But I&#8217;m using Selenium plugin for that.&#8221; &#8211; you might say. Sure, use that. But I&#8217;m using Chrome. &#8220;But there is iMacros for that.&#8221; &#8211; you might say again. Sure, I know&#8230; But! Let&#8217;s see which takes longer&#8230;</p>

<p>Open selenium, load the script, run it, see it fail, run it again, ahh success, good. Same with iMacros. As opposed to, having a Bookmarklet right in front of you, on your bookmark, and with a click of a button, or with entering something into the browsers search bar, you suddenly fill out the form and press submit.</p>

<p>You see the difference is that JavaScript runs faster and more accurate by it self in such short things then with a wrapper around it. And it&#8217;s faster accessible as well.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 5: Security</strong></p>

<p>There are all sorts of things that a security tester can do with a small script which gathers session information and availability.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 6: Accessibility</strong></p>

<p>This is of course the easiest one. There are ample of scripts and browser plugins to test accessibility which is an all time favourite for everybody in the front-end land. Make your life a little bit easier. How bout just running a bookmark like <a href="http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/">HTML_CodesSniffer</a> an see a very gorgeous result like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i1-scripts.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/HTML-CodeSniffer_1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ain&#8217;t it beautiful? What stops YOU from writing your own?</p>

<p>So get out there and learn JavaScript. It&#8217;s easy. I&#8217;m not telling you to become a front-end developer, just know thy tools and you shellet receive the blessings of the IT Gods.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>Today I would like to write a few words about Chrome&#8217;s Search Engines.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re probably already using it for a couple of things, like Google, or Amazon searches or YouTube or anything like that. But are you using it to access environments and testing tools faster, with queries?</p>

<p>For example, here is a quick Jira Search made easy:</p>

<p>Keyword: jira</p>

<p>URL: <a href="https://atlas.projectname.com/jira/browse/PROJECT-%s">https://atlas.projectname.com/jira/browse/PROJECT-%s</a></p>

<p>So just type: jira|space|9999</p>

<p>Will immediately bring you to your ticket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah, why would I want that?&#8221; &#8211; you ask.</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s easy, and quick access, but wait. There is more. How about you want to access a test environment that changes only a number?</p>

<p>Keyword: testenv</p>

<p>URL: <a href="https://qa%s.projectname.com/testenv">https://qa%s.projectname.com/testenv</a></p>

<p>Just type: testenv|space|14</p>

<p>&#8220;Humbug!&#8221; &#8211; you might say. &#8220;What if I have a different URL for an admin site and my main web site AND the number, hmmm? Also I have that stuff bookmarked anyways&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; you might add in.</p>

<p>Well, don&#8217;t fret. By default, Chrome, does not provide this. I know FF does, but I don&#8217;t like FF. That&#8217;s that. So I have to make due with what I have. And indeed there is a solution for using multiple search parameters. It&#8217;s is a JavaScript you can add in into the URL part and Chrome will interpret that. You can find that JavaScript in a few posts but you will find that THAT script is actually Wrong. Here is the <strong>fixed</strong> Script, courtesy of yours truly:</p>

<p>So no you will have an entry like this:</p>

<p>Keyword: testenv</p>

<p>URL: paste in the upper script</p>

<p>And try&#8230; testenv|space|admin;14 =&gt; which should result in: <a href="https://admin.test14.projectname.com/">https://admin.test14.projectname.com/</a></p>

<p>The location.replace at the end will bring you to the web page. It&#8217;s interesting to note the s will be replaced by admin;14 which is a nice magic by JavaScript.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This only works on a page like google.co.uk. For chrome pages, like the new tab, omnibox has this ability disabled unfortunately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then it&#8217;s completely useless, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; &#8211; you might say. Well, it&#8217;s usage is limited in power, that&#8217;s true. But it&#8217;s still useful as I&#8217;m sure you have a couple of pages open anyways which you don&#8217;t mind using up&#8230;? And you have to remember less keywords only a few powerful ones.</p>

                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>A quick post about an interesting idea.</p>

<p>I want to elaborate on a possibility to use the Strategy Design pattern.</p>

<p>There are many clues that you need one. One is for example if your object has a boolean variable which you use a lot in other classes to determine behavior. Then there is perhaps time to implement a Strategy.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">

<p>So you have two classes which do something based on some boolean coming from a class. So what you can do in this case, simply extract out that change in state.</p>

<p>Now I know this looks like a lot of more code. However imagine this on a much larger scale with lots of implementations for Foo and Bar. Your if statements will get very convulated very quickly. This way you abstract away the choice into a Factory. And you can add as many implementations of Base as you like with as many variants as you like without changing the logic anywhere else but the Factory and the Enum. And the Enum could be a Configuration file and you do something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">   <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">static</span> Base getMeAClass<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #003399;">String</span> className<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
        <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;">//Where className could be coming from a configuration file</span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Class</span> clazz <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Class</span>.<span style="color: #006633;">forName</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>className<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">return</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>Base<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> clazz.<span style="color: #006633;">newInstance</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
    <span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This way you don&#8217;t even need the Enum anymore. Just use some configuration to determine what class you need at which point in your implementation without using an If statement at all.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I whipped this up from memory so please feel free to tell me if I missed something or have a syntax error in there somewhere&#8230;</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>A quick post about an interesting idea.</p>

<p>I want to elaborate on a possibility to use the Strategy Design pattern.</p>

<p>There are many clues that you need one. One is for example if your object has a boolean variable which you use a lot in other classes to determine behavior. Then there is perhaps time to implement a Strategy.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>So you have two classes which do something based on some boolean coming from a class. So what you can do in this case, simply extract out that change in state.</p>

<p>Now I know this looks like a lot of more code. However imagine this on a much larger scale with lots of implementations for Foo and Bar. Your if statements will get very convulated very quickly. This way you abstract away the choice into a Factory. And you can add as many implementations of Base as you like with as many variants as you like without changing the logic anywhere else but the Factory and the Enum. And the Enum could be a Configuration file and you do something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">   <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">static</span> Base getMeAClass<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #003399;">String</span> className<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
        <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;">//Where className could be coming from a configuration file</span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Class</span> clazz <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Class</span>.<span style="color: #006633;">forName</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>className<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">return</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>Base<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> clazz.<span style="color: #006633;">newInstance</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
    <span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This way you don&#8217;t even need the Enum anymore. Just use some configuration to determine what class you need at which point in your implementation without using an If statement at all.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I whipped this up from memory so please feel free to tell me if I missed something or have a syntax error in there somewhere&#8230;</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
