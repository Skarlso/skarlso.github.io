      <description>I thought I throw my grudge out of the window against Scala and try something with it.
I also got my hands on a fairly new book, called: &amp;ldquo;Learning Scala: Practical Functional Programming for the JVM&amp;rdquo;. Turns out to be a rather fun book to read. And Jason Swartz has a nice way of writing. So I wanted to play around with Play 2 Framework. It now comes packaged in Activator.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
Today I want to write to you about learning something with a visual mind. There are a gazillion posts out there that tell you how to learn something with a visual mind. However, there are only a few actually describing how to learn something as complicated and logical as programming. How do you draw up a function? How do you draw up a cycle or a structure?
Actually these are really easy.</description>
