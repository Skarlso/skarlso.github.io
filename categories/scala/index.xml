      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I throw my grudge out of the window against Scala and try something with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got my hands on a fairly new book, called: &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Scala-Practical-Functional-Programming/dp/1449367933/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422340157&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=learning+scala+a+practical&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learning Scala: Practical Functional Programming for the JVM&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. Turns out to be a rather fun book to read. And Jason Swartz has a nice way of writing. So I wanted to play around with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.playframework.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Play 2 Framework&lt;/a&gt;. It now comes packaged in &lt;a href=&#34;https://typesafe.com/get-started&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Activator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi folks.
Today I want to write to you about learning something with a visual mind. There are a gazillion posts out there that tell you how to learn something with a visual mind. However, there are only a few actually describing how to learn something as complicated and logical as programming. How do you draw up a function? How do you draw up a cycle or a structure?
Actually these are really easy.</description>
