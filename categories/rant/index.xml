      <description>There is a small tip I&amp;rsquo;d like to share about this. People write that in order to get better, you&amp;rsquo;d have to write code.
This is a partial truth imho. I was recently talking with a friend of mine about these things and realized that I&amp;rsquo;ve done this before but I&amp;rsquo;ve neglected this practice and I was missing it now. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s the single most important thing you could do to TRULY be better at something.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
Just a quick headsup, that older posts and images, may have been lost unfortunately, because I made the terrible mistake, when I migrated over from my old blog, that I forgot to download all the images from the remote host.
For lack of options, I deleted the images. :/ Sorry for the inconvencience!
