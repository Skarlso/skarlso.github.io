      <description>Hi folks.
Just a quick headsup, that older posts and images, may have been lost unfortunately, because I made the terrible mistake, when I migrated over from my old blog, that I forgot to download all the images from the remote host.
For lack of options, I deleted the images. :/ Sorry for the inconvencience!
