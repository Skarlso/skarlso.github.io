      <description>Hello dear reader.
I switched to a new theme that has Dark Mode. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping nothing changed regarding the RSS functionality.
I removed the comments because I rarely used them.
Also disabled any sort of tracking.
Enjoy, Gergely.</description>

      <description>Welcome dear reader.
When last we met, we talked a lot about setting up Tilt for rapid controller development.
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s see how powerful Tilt can be once we bring it together with Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; e2e-framework.
Controller E2E Framework I&amp;rsquo;d like to present my controller-e2e-framework which brings Tilt and e2e-framework together to easily write and run tests for controllers that work together.
This framework can be used to integration test or e2e test controllers that work together.</description>

researching tilt what it could do for me understanding the Tilt file trivial mapping of the developer process understanding Starlark adding more features tackling hot swapping troubleshooting Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.</description>
