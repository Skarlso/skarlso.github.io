      <description>Hi folks.
Today&amp;rsquo;s is a quick tip for keeping your forks updated.
If you are like me, and have at least a 100 forks in your repository because: * You would like to contribute at some point * Save it for yourself because you are afraid that it disappears * Would like to make modifications for your own benefit * Whatever the reason
&amp;hellip;then you probably have a lot of trouble keeping them updated and making sure you always see the latest change.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
This is but a simple git hook to run a test in order to ensure you can push. It also ignores the vendor folder if you happen to have on in your directory.
Edit the file under .git/hooks/pre-push.sample and add this at the end before the exit 0.
go test $(go list ./... |grep -v vendor) RESULT=$? if [ $RESULT -ne 0 ]; then echo &amp;#34;Failed test run. Disallowing push.</description>
