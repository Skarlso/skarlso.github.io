      <description>Intro Hi folks.
Today, I would like to write about how to do HTTPS for a website, without the need to buy a certificate and set it up via your DNS provider. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.
Abstract What you will achieve by the end of this post:
 Every call to HTTP will be redirected to HTTPS via haproxy. HTTPS will be served with Haproxy and LetsEncrypt as the Certificate provider. Automatically update the certificate before its expiration.</description>
