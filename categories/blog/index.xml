      <description>Blog Refactor Finally, I went back and fixed a lot of old posts and old code entries. I tried to fix and repair links and images, but some are lost forever on some obscure WordPress blog which I used to use.
I&amp;rsquo;m glad though that the code is intact and I could re-read a lot of my old stuff. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how much I evolved, how much my writing evolved.</description>

      <description>Hello Folks Welcome to my new blog. I decided to move away for a number of reasons, but setting up a static page blog site is very cool if you don&amp;rsquo;t directly use a database. Since posts are just posts and I have a different way of hosting images, this really was just a matter of time.
And Hugo / Github pages provided the tools which made this move possible.</description>
