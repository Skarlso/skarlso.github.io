      <description>Hello Folks Welcome to my new blog. I decided to move away for a number of reasons, but setting up a static page blog site is very cool if you don&amp;rsquo;t directly use a database. Since posts are just posts and I have a different way of hosting images, this really was just a matter of time.
And Hugo / Github pages provided the tools which made this move possible.</description>
