      <description>Intro Hi folks.
Today, I would like to write about how to do HTTPS for a website, without the need to buy a certificate and set it up via your DNS provider. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.
Abstract What you will achieve by the end of this post: - Every call to HTTP will be redirected to HTTPS via haproxy. - HTTPS will be served with Haproxy and LetsEncrypt as the Certificate provider.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Here is a little something I&amp;rsquo;ve put together, since I&amp;rsquo;m doing it a lot.
Go Development Environment
If I have a project I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute, like GoHugo, I have to setup a development environment, because most of the times, I&amp;rsquo;m on a Mac. And on OSX things work differently. I like to work in a Linux environment since that&amp;rsquo;s what most of the projects are built on.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
If you have the tendency, like me, to forget that you are on the corporate VPN, or leave a certain software open when you bring your laptop to work, this might be helpful to you too.
It&amp;#8217;s a small script which kills a program when you change your Wifi network.
Script:
  #!/bin/bash &amp;nbsp; function log &amp;#123; directory=&#34;/Users/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/wifi_detect&#34; log_dir_exists=true if &amp;#91; ! -d $directory &amp;#93;; then echo &#34;</description>

      <description>Hi Folks.
Ever used Job DSL plugin for Jenkins? What is that you say? Well, it&amp;#8217;s TEH most awesome plug-in for Jenkins to have, because you can CODE your job configuration and put it under source control.
Today, however, I&amp;#8217;m not going to write about that because the tutorials on Jenkins JOB DSL are very extensive and very well done. Anyone can pick them up.
Today, I would like to write about a part of it which is even more interesting.</description>

      <title>How to Aggregate Tests with Jenkins with Aggregate Plugin on non-relating jobs</title>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today, I would like to talk about something I came in contact with, and was hard to find a proper answer / solution for it.
So I&amp;#8217;m writing this down to document my findings. Like the title says, this is about aggregating test result with Jenkins, using the plug-in provided. If you, like me, have a pipeline structure which do not work on the same artifact, but do have a upstream-downstream relationship, you will have a hard time configuring and making Aggregation work.</description>

      <title>Selenium Testing with Packer and Vagrant</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, recently, the tester team talked to me, that their build takes too long, and why is that? A quick look at their configuration and build scripts showed me, that they are actually using a vagrant box, which never gets destroyed or re-started at least. To remedy this problem, I came up with the following solution&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Packer 0.8.1.</title>

      <description>Previously I wrote that the scripts I&amp;#8217;m writing, are failing because Packer hangs.
Apparently, this was a known issue. And apparently, I was using an older version, 0.7.5. After I updated everything is working wonderfully!!!
And for my thanks, here is an updated PowerShell script for provisioning my dotnet stuff.

      <description>Hello folks.
Today, I would like to show you a small script. It installs Java JDK, both version, x86 and 64 bit, silently, and wait for that process to finish.
The wait is necessary because /s on a java install has the nasty habit of running in the background. If you are using a .bat file, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t, than you would use something like: start /w jdk-setup.exe /s. This gets it done, but is ugly.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to write about something close to my heart recently. I&amp;#8217;ve been fiddling with Packer, Windows and Vagrant these days. Trying to get a Windows box up in running is a pain in the arse though, so I thought I share my pain with you nice folks out there. Let&amp;#8217;s begin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to write about something interesting and close to me at the moment. I&amp;#8217;m going to setup Go.cd with Docker, and I&amp;#8217;m going to get a Ruby Lotus app running. Let&amp;#8217;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hello folks.
So, some of you know puppet, some of you don&amp;#8217;t. Puppet is a configuration management system. It&amp;#8217;s quite awesome. I like working with it. One of the benefits of puppet is, that I never, ever, EVER have to setup a new laptop from scratch, EVER again.
I&amp;#8217;m writing a puppet manifest file which sets up my new laptop to my liking. I will improve it as I go along.</description>

      <description>Fact is, I&amp;#8217;ve been busy.
I&amp;#8217;ve got a new job as a build engineer. As sort of a devops kind of guy. It&amp;#8217;s extremely interesting considering that I made a career as a tester. Granted, I always was technical, and never really knew my path; but it seems my path is finding me after all.
In the past years, I got better at Docker, Puppet, Chef, AWS, Packer, Vagrant, Gradle, and a hell of a lot more.</description>
