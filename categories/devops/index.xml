      <description>Intro Hi folks.
Today, I would like to write about how to do HTTPS for a website, without the need to buy a certificate and set it up via your DNS provider. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.
Abstract What you will achieve by the end of this post:
 Every call to HTTP will be redirected to HTTPS via haproxy. HTTPS will be served with Haproxy and LetsEncrypt as the Certificate provider. Automatically update the certificate before its expiration.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Here is a little something I&amp;rsquo;ve put together, since I&amp;rsquo;m doing it a lot.
Go Development Environment
If I have a project I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute, like GoHugo, I have to setup a development environment, because most of the times, I&amp;rsquo;m on a Mac. And on OSX things work differently. I like to work in a Linux environment since that&amp;rsquo;s what most of the projects are built on.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
If you have the tendency, like me, to forget that you are on the corporate VPN, or leave a certain software open when you bring your laptop to work, this might be helpful to you too.
It’s a small script which kills a program when you change your Wifi network.
Script:
Now, the trick is, on OSX to only trigger this when your network changes. For this, you can have a ‘launchd’ daemon, which is configured to watch three files which relate to a network being changed.</description>

      <description>Hi Folks.
Ever used Job DSL pluginfor Jenkins? What is that you say? Well, it’s TEH most awesome plug-in for Jenkins to have, because you can CODE your job configuration and put it under source control.
Today, however, I’m not going to write about that because the tutorials on Jenkins JOB DSL are very extensive and very well done. Anyone can pick them up.
Today, I would like to write about a part of it which is even more interesting.</description>

      <title>How to Aggregate Tests with Jenkins with Aggregate Plugin on non-relating jobs</title>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today, I would like to talk about something I came in contact with, and was hard to find a proper answer / solution for it.
So I’m writing this down to document my findings. Like the title says, this is about aggregating test result with Jenkins, using the plug-in provided. If you, like me, have a pipeline structure which do not work on the same artifact, but do have a upstream-downstream relationship, you will have a hard time configuring and making Aggregation work.</description>
