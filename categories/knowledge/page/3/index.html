                        <p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>I attended a 4 day course of Groovy and Grails and this is my attempt at writing up a summary to see how much I retained. I&#8217;ll try to do this from the top of my head without peaking at my notes.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s begin.</p>

<p><strong>Introductions</strong></p>

<p>First of all, introductions. The course was held by Peter Ledbrook. He is the guy who wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grails-Action-Peter-Ledbrook/dp/1617290963/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365713080&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=peter+ledbrook" title="Grails in Action">Grails in Action</a>. He is awesome, go check him out. :: <a href="https://twitter.com/pledbrook" title="Twitter for Peter">Twitter</a> ::</p>

<p>The place where it was held is <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/" title="Skills Matter">Skillsmatter</a>. Which of course is known to all, if not, go check them out as well!</p>

<p><strong>Day One</strong></p>

<p>Day one and two were about Groovy. We were faced with the quirks and hinges of the language. First tasks were Closures and Currying both of which were really interesting. A bit of functional thinking mixed into the soup.</p>

<p>The course was divided into Peter telling us about stuff for 1:30 hours and then 1:00 hour lab work which really made the whole thing interactive. We could ask questions while he was talking which I&#8217;m sure was very distracting but I hope he is used to it by now. 😉</p>

<p>The tasks which we faced I&#8217;m sure were no real challenge for somebody who was used to thinking with closures and functions. But for us they were very intriguing.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty damn awesome.</p>

<p>For quite some time now functional languages are re-living their golden age. There are various reasons for that which I won&#8217;t list here. But it has mainly to do with scalability, concurrency and threaded programming. Also the need to eliminate boilerplate code is bigger then ever. I guess people got fed up with Java being so talkative.</p>

<p>So we moved on learning a lot about groovy and its power. We also learned some good practices from Peter what to do and what not to do. For example a line he always repeated is that he hates how a function cannot exist without a class wrapped around it. Another important thing is, which we never ever should forget, that closures are Closures. Which means they aren&#8217;t functions. They are of the type Closure.</p>

<p>And that we shouldn&#8217;t use Closures just because we can. Be sensible. If a method can achieve your task, use a method.</p>

<p><strong>Day Two</strong></p>

<p>On day 2 we got into meta-programming. That&#8217;s when the real fun started. Groovy is not only powerful and lightweight it also gives the ability to change its behaviour. Meta programming is sort of a bit new to me. So this was my first definitive intro to it. But I must say that it blew me away. The capabilities are limitless.</p>

<p>There is a class called Expando in groovy which can be used to create virtually anything on the fly what you want.</p>

<p>For example look at this code ::</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">

<p>Neat hmm? Just create expando and build up the class as you go however you want to use it.</p>

<p>And you can do this jazz to other, normal classes as well. You can add properties and methods at runtime by implementing the propertyMissing and methodMissing methods. In them afterwards you can specify some custom behaviour you would like to see. By implementing these guys you can directly control what&#8217;s happening to your class. Who is calling it how and where and why.</p>

<p>To grasp the power of metacoding and the abilities with which closures provided us with took a day to properly go over. So we moved on&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Day Three</strong></p>

<p>So groovy was over. The time has come to move on and venture into the foggy land of Grails. Turned out it wasn&#8217;t so foggy after all.</p>

<p>Grails is a rapid prototyping kind of a framework. It allows you to set up an application with a blink of an eye. And provides conventions over configuration which is a really good thing to have. But as the day was going by we realised that we would find ourself not once but many times in the bubbling boils of the underbelly of /conf.</p>

<p>Again, fortunately, it wasn&#8217;t really hard. The config was groovy and it was pretty straight forward too.</p>

<p>Our third day mostly took as off to explore scaffolding, dynamic &amp; static as well, and the interesting land of GORM Peter showed us the power of grails to create a CRUD application with in a matter of seconds / minutes ( depending on how fast your machine is ) with a fairly nice view. These types of application are usually not accepted of course as an end product&#8230; For that you need to thinker a bit here and there.</p>

<p>But things like admin portal are easily put together. So use it often and use it will and get it to know how it works.</p>

<p>In the land of GORM we explored the 4 different possibilities of data retriaval and generally how everything maps together and how GORM work with ORM.</p>

<p>The four different retrieval capabilities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where clauses</li>
<li>HQL (Hybernate Query Language)</li>
<li>Criteria searches</li>
<li>Dynamic finder methods</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of which we found very interesting in there own respective ways.</p>

<p>Example of a dynamic finder::</p>

<p>Where propertyName is the name of the property to find by, modifier can be a sql&#8217;s Like for example.</p>

<p>So this could become something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">assert</span> Hitman.<span style="color: #006600;">findAllByNameLike</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Agent %"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">==</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">15</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>That day was really knowledge packed. I don&#8217;t say I remember everything but luckily I wrote up some notes and I know what and where to look for if I would be in need of something.</p>

<p><strong>Day Four</strong></p>

<p>On the last day everybody was pretty much exhausted. It takes a lot to learn all that from 9 to 5 for 4 days. And Peter gave his best to staff that stuff into our heads and as much as possible of it. I think he did a pretty good job.</p>

<p>Last day was all about Controllers, Commands, Models, Views and GSPs and BootStrap config, Environment changes durring start up, the configurability of the whole framework, messages, templates, internationalisation and many thing more which can be easily put together.</p>

<p>It was pretty interesting. GSPs have similarities to JSPs but retained only the good parts. And although you can do JSP stuff in GSPs as well with nice embedded tags you have the ability to actually create a nice page which won&#8217;t be that big a maintenance nightmare.</p>

<p>Peter very much pressed the fact that the Controllers should be your only entry point from HTML requests and the views should be the only output of it. The controllers shouldn&#8217;t be throwing around business logic they should only act as proxies between the outer shell and the inner layering.</p>

<p>I think I understood most of the stuff which we were going through. Again, it was pretty straight forward. The application of it is what need practice.</p>

<p>Durring the course we created several applications. With dynamic scaffolding as well as static. We created and edited our own views and gsps. Created our own Controllers and what nots. One thing is clear. Grails let&#8217;s you progress a hell of a lot in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>And we were also talking about testing of course. Using Geb, Spock and the unit testing capabilities of Grails. All very powerful stuff. Spock has some impressive Mocking powers in junction with the good ol&#8217; Given When Then structure. If done correctly the test can be very fast and robust.</p>

<p>As final words we talked about plugins and the testing of Views and a bit more configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Closing words</strong></p>

<p>So all in all the course was excellent. Peter did a very good job of introducing use to Grails and Groovy. It&#8217;s a very good framework to build upon with a powerful language at our disposal. I&#8217;m pretty certain that Grails will evolve even more and be a great asset to people who choose to develop with it. Handle with Care though. Because no matter how awesome a tool is, it can always be used for bad purposes. 😉</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and have a nice day / evening.</p>

                        <p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>I attended a 4 day course of Groovy and Grails and this is my attempt at writing up a summary to see how much I retained. I&#8217;ll try to do this from the top of my head without peaking at my notes.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s begin.</p>

<p><strong>Introductions</strong></p>

<p>First of all, introductions. The course was held by Peter Ledbrook. He is the guy who wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grails-Action-Peter-Ledbrook/dp/1617290963/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365713080&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=peter+ledbrook" title="Grails in Action">Grails in Action</a>. He is awesome, go check him out. :: <a href="https://twitter.com/pledbrook" title="Twitter for Peter">Twitter</a> ::</p>

<p>The place where it was held is <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/" title="Skills Matter">Skillsmatter</a>. Which of course is known to all, if not, go check them out as well!</p>

<p><strong>Day One</strong></p>

<p>Day one and two were about Groovy. We were faced with the quirks and hinges of the language. First tasks were Closures and Currying both of which were really interesting. A bit of functional thinking mixed into the soup.</p>

<p>The course was divided into Peter telling us about stuff for 1:30 hours and then 1:00 hour lab work which really made the whole thing interactive. We could ask questions while he was talking which I&#8217;m sure was very distracting but I hope he is used to it by now. 😉</p>

<p>The tasks which we faced I&#8217;m sure were no real challenge for somebody who was used to thinking with closures and functions. But for us they were very intriguing.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty damn awesome.</p>

<p>For quite some time now functional languages are re-living their golden age. There are various reasons for that which I won&#8217;t list here. But it has mainly to do with scalability, concurrency and threaded programming. Also the need to eliminate boilerplate code is bigger then ever. I guess people got fed up with Java being so talkative.</p>

<p>So we moved on learning a lot about groovy and its power. We also learned some good practices from Peter what to do and what not to do. For example a line he always repeated is that he hates how a function cannot exist without a class wrapped around it. Another important thing is, which we never ever should forget, that closures are Closures. Which means they aren&#8217;t functions. They are of the type Closure.</p>

<p>And that we shouldn&#8217;t use Closures just because we can. Be sensible. If a method can achieve your task, use a method.</p>

<p><strong>Day Two</strong></p>

<p>On day 2 we got into meta-programming. That&#8217;s when the real fun started. Groovy is not only powerful and lightweight it also gives the ability to change its behaviour. Meta programming is sort of a bit new to me. So this was my first definitive intro to it. But I must say that it blew me away. The capabilities are limitless.</p>

<p>There is a class called Expando in groovy which can be used to create virtually anything on the fly what you want.</p>

<p>For example look at this code ::</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>

<p>Neat hmm? Just create expando and build up the class as you go however you want to use it.</p>

<p>And you can do this jazz to other, normal classes as well. You can add properties and methods at runtime by implementing the propertyMissing and methodMissing methods. In them afterwards you can specify some custom behaviour you would like to see. By implementing these guys you can directly control what&#8217;s happening to your class. Who is calling it how and where and why.</p>

<p>To grasp the power of metacoding and the abilities with which closures provided us with took a day to properly go over. So we moved on&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Day Three</strong></p>

<p>So groovy was over. The time has come to move on and venture into the foggy land of Grails. Turned out it wasn&#8217;t so foggy after all.</p>

<p>Grails is a rapid prototyping kind of a framework. It allows you to set up an application with a blink of an eye. And provides conventions over configuration which is a really good thing to have. But as the day was going by we realised that we would find ourself not once but many times in the bubbling boils of the underbelly of /conf.</p>

<p>Again, fortunately, it wasn&#8217;t really hard. The config was groovy and it was pretty straight forward too.</p>

<p>Our third day mostly took as off to explore scaffolding, dynamic &amp; static as well, and the interesting land of GORM Peter showed us the power of grails to create a CRUD application with in a matter of seconds / minutes ( depending on how fast your machine is ) with a fairly nice view. These types of application are usually not accepted of course as an end product&#8230; For that you need to thinker a bit here and there.</p>

<p>But things like admin portal are easily put together. So use it often and use it will and get it to know how it works.</p>

<p>In the land of GORM we explored the 4 different possibilities of data retriaval and generally how everything maps together and how GORM work with ORM.</p>

<p>The four different retrieval capabilities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where clauses</li>
<li>HQL (Hybernate Query Language)</li>
<li>Criteria searches</li>
<li>Dynamic finder methods</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of which we found very interesting in there own respective ways.</p>

<p>Example of a dynamic finder::</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">assert</span> Account.<span style="color: #006600;">findAllBy</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">*</span>PropertyName<span style="color: #66cc66;">**</span><span style="color: #aaaadd; font-weight: bold;">Modifier</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">*</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span>Parameters<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>.<span style="color: #663399;">size</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">==</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">2</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Where propertyName is the name of the property to find by, modifier can be a sql&#8217;s Like for example.</p>

<p>So this could become something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">assert</span> Hitman.<span style="color: #006600;">findAllByNameLike</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Agent %"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">==</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">15</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>That day was really knowledge packed. I don&#8217;t say I remember everything but luckily I wrote up some notes and I know what and where to look for if I would be in need of something.</p>

<p><strong>Day Four</strong></p>

<p>On the last day everybody was pretty much exhausted. It takes a lot to learn all that from 9 to 5 for 4 days. And Peter gave his best to staff that stuff into our heads and as much as possible of it. I think he did a pretty good job.</p>

<p>Last day was all about Controllers, Commands, Models, Views and GSPs and BootStrap config, Environment changes durring start up, the configurability of the whole framework, messages, templates, internationalisation and many thing more which can be easily put together.</p>

<p>It was pretty interesting. GSPs have similarities to JSPs but retained only the good parts. And although you can do JSP stuff in GSPs as well with nice embedded tags you have the ability to actually create a nice page which won&#8217;t be that big a maintenance nightmare.</p>

<p>Peter very much pressed the fact that the Controllers should be your only entry point from HTML requests and the views should be the only output of it. The controllers shouldn&#8217;t be throwing around business logic they should only act as proxies between the outer shell and the inner layering.</p>

<p>I think I understood most of the stuff which we were going through. Again, it was pretty straight forward. The application of it is what need practice.</p>

<p>Durring the course we created several applications. With dynamic scaffolding as well as static. We created and edited our own views and gsps. Created our own Controllers and what nots. One thing is clear. Grails let&#8217;s you progress a hell of a lot in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>And we were also talking about testing of course. Using Geb, Spock and the unit testing capabilities of Grails. All very powerful stuff. Spock has some impressive Mocking powers in junction with the good ol&#8217; Given When Then structure. If done correctly the test can be very fast and robust.</p>

<p>As final words we talked about plugins and the testing of Views and a bit more configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Closing words</strong></p>

<p>So all in all the course was excellent. Peter did a very good job of introducing use to Grails and Groovy. It&#8217;s a very good framework to build upon with a powerful language at our disposal. I&#8217;m pretty certain that Grails will evolve even more and be a great asset to people who choose to develop with it. Handle with Care though. Because no matter how awesome a tool is, it can always be used for bad purposes. 😉</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and have a nice day / evening.</p>

                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;d like to share with you some of the experiences I had as a beginner tester. I hope it sets you off on a path to enlightenment and leaves you off with a good appetite for testing. Shall we begin then?</p>

<p><strong>The early days</strong></p>

<p>It was 2004 when I finished school and started working at my first company. I finished as a software developer which is kind of an exaggeration since I only finished a 2 years course of it. I wasn&#8217;t really one for school. I was more of a home learner. That&#8217;s how you learn programming these days anyways.</p>

<p>The company didn&#8217;t hire developers at that moment. At least not junior ones&#8230; But! They were kind enough to offer a position as a tester. As the saying goes, Don&#8217;t look a gift horse in the mouth, I accepted the position although my intention was to go over to development as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Years went by. I was still a tester. I foamed and fumed about it I wanted to be a dev guy. I was furious. I was angry. I was inpatient. I was an idiot. Instead of crying and instead of the light going on after 2-3 years or more I should have realised the potential of my position sooner.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation</strong></p>

<p>So there I was. I was sitting at my desk clicking away at stuff and writing up dull documentations about why I&#8217;m clicking at that stuff and how I&#8217;m clicking it. My document infect was so pretty and well formatted that I was fairly proud of it.</p>

<p>I ignored calls of my sanity and went on producing test cases and documents for many many more months / years. I was bad at my job. And I tell you why. I missed bugs I missed the little things that made the difference. I was following documentation by the letter I was leaving out things I wasn&#8217;t paying attention I wanted to be a developer damn it!</p>

<p>But fortunately because of various people in my life, like my brother, my resource manager, my friends and this guy :: James Marcus Bach ( <a href="http://www.satisfice.com/" title="http://www.satisfice.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.satisfice.com/">http://www.satisfice.com/</a></a> ) :: I soon begun to realise that this job is about so much more! I read Jame&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.buccaneerscholar.com/" title="The buccaneer scholar" target="_blank">The buccaneer scholar</a>.</p>

<p>It opened my eyes in so many ways. I knew that there is somebody else out there how is like me. Passionet and keen on learning new things. Exploring technology and going where nobody else went before. I was beginning to understand that I could be much more in this position. In my country at that time Testers weren&#8217;t regarded for too much. We were the enemy that needed defeating. We were in the way. We were somebody who had to be hated. Fortunately it changed much since then and lucky for us The Company had great support for Testers.</p>

<p>I learned that I can use my passion. I learned that testing can be / IS, indeed, the best thing that could have happened to me.</p>

<p><strong>Ascension</strong></p>

<p>With these new thoughts in my mind I begun to evolve. I realised that I can incorporate my dev skills into testing and later my testing skill into development. I was no longer following test cases blindly. I was no longer writing up pretty documentations ( I was writing other kind of documentations.. 😉 ). I was following instinct, skills, knowledge I hoarded from people. I was talking to the Devs, I was talking to the deployment team, I was talking to the managers AND the product owners. I hoarded knowledge as much as possible. I wrote everything down into my Mind Maps and was determined to become the single most knowledgable entity on the projects I was working on.</p>

<p>I created small tools that helped in my tedious, boring, unimaginative tasks of repetitive clicking. It didn&#8217;t took so long I was sharing my tools between other testers. Small javascripts which filled in forms. Tools, perl scripts to format docs and test results and so and so forth.</p>

<p>I embraced testing. It become my way of Life. It wasn&#8217;t a simple job anymore. It was embedded into my brain processes and synapses. And that&#8217;s when I got into automation.</p>

<p><strong>The later years</strong></p>

<p>So I got into automation. I loved it. The thought that I can bend the computers will to do my bidding / job was absolutely mind blowing. I&#8217;ve done development at that point already of course that wasn&#8217;t new to me. And I also was shown some way of automation but that wasn&#8217;t so great so I dismissed this possibility for a long time. After a while I came back to it with the thought that, hey I could do this better. Selenium came out at that time around, Watir was also there and a couple of other tools in Perl.</p>

<p>I started developing with / in / for those tools and noted that despite the believe that it&#8217;s only automation it actually took quite some thinking to come up with a framework that was adaptable, concise, manageable, fast and so on and so fort. It was an effort that most people didn&#8217;t realise or care to know about.</p>

<p>So for the better part of those years I was trying to convince people that building a testing framework requires actual development work. And is not something that should be taken lightly. I sort of succeeded with it&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Now</strong></p>

<p>After various circumstances in my life I moved to UK and took a job as an SET(Software Developer in Test). It sounds fancy but is rather just an automation guy who from time to time looks at production code. It was a spring board for me. And now days it seems I&#8217;m simply just a developer. But!!! And here comes the twist.</p>

<p>Because of my years of background in Test I feel I&#8217;m so much more. I know to write testable code. I know many ways how my code could fail. I know many ways of writing something and then coding up a script for testing or do extensive unit testing. I don&#8217;t love my code blindly so that when it&#8217;s done I only test the &#8220;happy path&#8221; because I don&#8217;t have the time to code up more.</p>

<p>I will always have time for testing. I will <strong>begin</strong> with testing. Because people need to understand that the only way to go fast is to go slow. If you go fast it will bite you in the behind and you will suffer more then you would have suffered if you would have written up that one last little test for that one last little corner for the world that is your boiling, brooding, breathing pile of code.</p>

<p><strong>The future</strong></p>

<p>Honestly I don&#8217;t know were I&#8217;m going from here. Being a full pledged developed is a new territory for me even though I was an automation dev before. But I&#8217;m looking forward to this exciting new life. And I will NEVER ditch my Testing carrier. In fact I&#8217;m aiming to complete the BBST course next month. Because once you&#8217;ve been a tester you will never go back being anything else. It becomes a part of you. And stays with you forever.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>Today I would like to write about something I experienced over the years of being in the software industry.</p>

<p><strong>Some History</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been a tester for a long time now. I&#8217;ve been up and down and down and up. I struggled for a very long time until I became somebody who I am today. And I still have many things to learn ahead of me.</p>

<p>I learned from many people. I personally thing my greatest influence on testing was James Marcus Bach and his Brother Jon Bach you should definitely check out these guys. It took me a long time to get to where I am today. And after ~10 years now I can state with a reasonable confidence that this industry is no longer about technology or solutions to technological problems.</p>

<p><strong>Surly you Jest&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Nope&#8230; I&#8217;m not joking. I can see people struggling to understand people and mostly it&#8217;s not because of knowledge differences it&#8217;s because they simply can&#8217;t stand each other. Or they simply think that their solution must be better then the one the other has. Or the guy just woke up with a bad foot.</p>

<p>And industrial problems? Management? Sure it can be knowledge but mostly it&#8217;s simply ignorance and pride. <strong>Pride</strong> because he / she does not want to admit that they don&#8217;t understand something. <strong>Pride</strong> to ask a question that might make them look stupid. I&#8217;d rather look stupid for five minutes then for the rest of my life. I rather ask the question that I want to know because I can&#8217;t make a proper decision without it. I rather learn then be ignorant for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>People need to overcome their differences. People need to understand that this behaviour hurts the company. It hurts them it hurts the people around them and the product. Swallow your pride and be a bigger man / woman. Face your fear. Be Strong. Be clever be intelligent be a proper grown up human being!!!!</p>

<p>You hate my face? SAY IT IN MY FACE!! I can&#8217;t resolve issues I DON&#8217;T KNOW ABOUT!!</p>

<p><strong>Last but not least&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Grow up people. Be nice. Be curious. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask again if you still don&#8217;t understand. It might be that the person speaking has a completely different view of something and it might be that nobody really understands him and they are just afraid to ask. And if you ask something stupid? Who cares.. You learned from it.</p>

<p>Be a professional. A professional is not afraid. And encourage others to be one too. In the today&#8217;s technological world solutions can be found by the dozens on the internet. You will be a better work force by adjusting your personal habits a little bit.</p>

<p>Be nice.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>

I can see people struggling to understand people and mostly it&#8217;s not because of knowledge differences it&#8217;s because they simply can&#8217;t stand each other. Or they simply think that their solution must be better then the one the other has. Or the guy just woke up with a bad foot.</p>

<p>And industrial problems? Management? Sure it can be knowledge but mostly it&#8217;s simply ignorance and pride. <strong>Pride</strong> because he / she does not want to admit that they don&#8217;t understand something. <strong>Pride</strong> to ask a question that might make them look stupid. I&#8217;d rather look stupid for five minutes then for the rest of my life. I rather ask the question that I want to know because I can&#8217;t make a proper decision without it. I rather learn then be ignorant for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>People need to overcome their differences. People need to understand that this behaviour hurts the company. It hurts them it hurts the people around them and the product. Swallow your pride and be a bigger man / woman. Face your fear. Be Strong. Be clever be intelligent be a proper grown up human being!!!!</p>

<p>You hate my face? SAY IT IN MY FACE!! I can&#8217;t resolve issues I DON&#8217;T KNOW ABOUT!!</p>

<p><strong>Last but not least&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Grow up people. Be nice. Be curious. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask. Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask again if you still don&#8217;t understand. It might be that the person speaking has a completely different view of something and it might be that nobody really understands him and they are just afraid to ask. And if you ask something stupid? Who cares.. You learned from it.</p>

<p>Be a professional. A professional is not afraid. And encourage others to be one too. In the today&#8217;s technological world solutions can be found by the dozens on the internet. You will be a better work force by adjusting your personal habits a little bit.</p>

<p>Be nice.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>Today I would like to show you what you need to become a Testing expert.</p>

<p>If you had noticed I deliberately left out the word Software. Why? Because becoming and expert in Testing Anything has the same root as becoming an expert to test software. And for that let me take you back to a Galaxy Far Far Away in Time AND Space.</p>

<p><strong>The beginnings&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>I went to school in Oroszlany, my home town in Hungary. My official Technical title would be Mechanical Testing Engineer. I had the luck that most things which were thought at that school and I liked were thought by people I liked too and were clever in their respective fields. Like Pneumatics, Metallurgy, Mechanics, Chemistry these were all really awesome fields. To this day I don&#8217;t know why I haven&#8217;t ended up in some lab testing the breaking point of metals and the capacity of various chemicals.</p>

<p>But ahh well.. I still remember some of the ISO standards we had to memorize. Like in Metallurgy the Charpy pendulum impact test which we loved so very much to perform. The ISO standard for that is ISO 148-1:2009. Now let me see if I still remember that correctly&#8230; Yes! I&#8217;ve still got it. So where am I going with this?</p>

<p><strong>Moving on&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Back then we performed a lot of operations on various metals and a lot of chemical testings and the like. The most important part of every performed test was always to have insight. Insight in the structure of the metal. How it was made, how it was moulded and then shaped and heated and cooled and so on and so forth. We had to know EVERYTHING about the creation of this element that we had to test. Without that knowledge you could of corse still perform the test but you didn&#8217;t had any additional information why that test was useful or what it proved. Sure, you could have looked at the specification of the metal but that didn&#8217;t give you anything about the inner structure of it.</p>

<p>That was provided to you by the knowledge of the procedure that created it.</p>

<p>You get where I&#8217;m going with this&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Insight</strong></p>

<p>So back to software testing&#8230; What is the single most important thing that gives you insight, that gives you the edge to be a professional? Knowing the development process. Knowing architecture. Knowing programming. Knowing the language and its capabilities and limitations.</p>

<p>Sure you can be a good manual Tester. Of course you can be an excellent Exploratory Tester. But look at the others. James Marcus Bach. Alan Richardson. Michael Bolton and I could go on&#8230; They all know programming. They all know it by heart and they could be exceptional programmers if they wanted to. They already know that in order to get very good at testing something you must have an insight on the subject matter. You can&#8217;t test it thoughtfully without knowing its limitations its rules that it obeys its exploits that you can use.</p>

<p><strong>Last words&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>So in order to excel at your craft of test you have to have insight of the subject of the test. You can still become good but you always have to aim high don&#8217;t you? A friend of mine reply to one of my tweets with a really good sentence:&#8221;&#8230;and then you realize that being the best in one implies being excellent in the other.&#8221;. Exactly. Because the two are interconnected. They aren&#8217;t actually two. It&#8217;s one. It&#8217;s called Engineering.</p>

<p>Have a nice day and as always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
