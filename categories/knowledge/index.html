            	Hi Folks. Ever used Job DSL plugin for Jenkins? What is that you say? Well, it&#8217;s TEH most awesome plug-in for Jenkins to have, because you can CODE your job configuration and put it under source control. Today, however, I&#8217;m not going to write about that because the tutorials on Jenkins JOB DSL are very extensive and very well done. Anyone can pick them up. Today, I would like to write about a part of it which is even more interesting.

<p>Not a great many people know that I&#8217;m actually into Lock Picking as a hobby. This will not be a tutorial on how to do it, or I won&#8217;t really talk about how I do it; I would like to write about something completely different. So if you came here for that, here are a few very good resources:</p>

<p>This time I would like to write about something that interests me. I wanted to try out a pure JavaScript web framework.</p>

<p>My choice is: <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a>. Looks interesting enough and it was recommended by a friend of mine. So, let&#8217;s dive in.</p>

            	<p>Hi Folks!</p>

<p>I just wanted to share with you my mind map on the seven principles of Context Driven Testing.</p>

<p>I used the notion of dragons since it&#8217;s seven. And a dragon is usually seven headed in my mind&#8230;</p>

<p>So without further ado&#8230;</p>

<p>You&#8217;re probably already using it for a couple of things, like Google, or Amazon searches or YouTube or anything like that. But are you using it to access environments and testing tools faster, with queries?</p>

            	Hello. So let&#8217;s clarify this&#8230; They rarely or ever work if you are a beginner blogger. If you have a reputation it will probably work or people will use it as a reference. But I&#8217;m skipping ahead. Beginnings When you are a beginner blog writer you want to get out as much content as possible. Write mostly relevant things and interesting information because you need to establish a name for yourself.

            	Hello guys. I&#8217;d like to share a little something with you. It&#8217;s what I cooked up in Python to check an unknown number of content items in a web application. Basically the script runs from a script folder under Grails. It goes through all the configured folders where there is static content like images, javascript, css and so on and so forth.

            	Hello. Today I would like to write about something very interesting to you folks. It&#8217;s a common remember / recall technique called the Method of loci. Otherwise known as the Memory Palace. A very popular usage can be seen in the episodes of Sherlock Holmes from BBC. He uses it often. What is the Method of loci? As the Wikipedia page write so properly&#8230;&#8221;In basic terms, it is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information.&#8221; This says all&#8230; So&#8230; How does it work?

            	Hello, So Vim is a very powerful editing tool and has lots and lots of potential in regarding plug-ins. It has years and years of gathered knowledge and extensions and can virtually do anything you want. But that&#8217;s not even it&#8217;s final form&#8230; The real power of Vim lies in navigation and manipulation. The ability to navigate and edit without the use of arrow keys or mouse chops of a large portion of your time which you didn&#8217;t even realize you are wasting until you try it without it.

            	Hi folks. I attended a 4 day course of Groovy and Grails and this is my attempt at writing up a summary to see how much I retained. I&#8217;ll try to do this from the top of my head without peaking at my notes. So let&#8217;s begin. Introductions First of all, introductions. The course was held by Peter Ledbrook. He is the guy who wrote Grails in Action. He is awesome, go check him out.

I hope it sets you off on a path to enlightenment and leaves you off with a good appetite for testing. Shall we begin then? The early days It was 2004 when I finished school and started working at my first company. I finished as a software developer which is kind of an exaggeration since I only finished a 2 years course of it.

            	Hello everybody. Today I&#8217;d like to write about something I discovered over the years of researching and following certain people and movements in Testing and Programming world. Let me tell you that there are quite an amazing amount of stuff to be read out there. It&#8217;s overwhelming. Let&#8217;s talk about Methodologies first. There are many out there currently. In programming and in testing too. Many speak of ways how you should or should not do you work.

            	Hello Everybody. I&#8217;d like to introduce T.E.A.S. to you. This is something I came up with yesterday which requires a lot of fantasy some good thinking planning and enthusiastic people. So, let&#8217;s get started. What is it about? Testing Exploration Adventure Session is about&#8230; Testing! There. No real surprise, eh? TEAS has it&#8217;s roots in RPGs. Role Playing Games. If you ever heard or read about M.A.G.U.S. or the more known Dungeons &amp; Dragons you will have a better understanding of the concept behind this phenomena.

            	Hello folks. Today I want to write about a little trick I learned. If you are working with legacy code and you don&#8217;t have the chance to eliminate core design problems, you can use this little pattern to help you out. Problem Problem is that you have a class that has a gazillion collaborators and at some point in time one of the clever devs thought it would be a cool idea to do dependancy injection via the constructor.

            	Hi folks. Today I want to write to you about learning something with a visual mind. There are a gazillion posts out there that tell you how to learn something with a visual mind. However, there are only a few actually describing how to learn something as complicated and logical as programming. How do you draw up a function? How do you draw up a cycle or a structure? Actually these are really easy.

            	So today at 8-12PM I had a great session with two friends of mine. It was awesome. Like a mini code retreat. We set down in a musky bar, drank wine and beer and cider, and decided to practice some TDD with the well known problem of Conway&#8217;s Game of Life. This challenge is really interesting. I never done it before, ever. So it was a really good practice for me.

            	Hi everybody. Today I want to talk to you about.. Well.. How to read a professional book for slow learners without too much waste of time. Let us start at the&#8230; well&#8230; the beginning. How do you normally read a book if you want to memorize it properly. You read it once and then re read the whole thing again until it gets in your head? Or do you have another strategy?

            	Hi. Today I want to talk about a common problem in many frameworks I encountered over the course of my carrier as a Java dev / automation engineer, whatnot. Throwing Exceptions. That is in your method you have something like this: 1 public void insertMethodNameHere&#40;String param&#41; throws Exception &#123;&#125; This is bad. And I will tell you in short forms why. Hides exceptions This one should be obvious. When a method throws exception you can never be sure what kind of exceptions it handles.

            	Hi folks. I want to write a little bit about writing a professional blog. Early steps Let&#8217;s first talk about what you understand about professional blog. It&#8217;s either a semi professional one, that mixes life with professionalism, like chess, programming, testing, painting, drawing, engineering whatever your profession is. Or it can be a purely professional one without your life getting involved in it. Either way you have to decide at the beginning.

            	Hi! I&#8217;ve seen this many times over and over again. Many people have wrote books about it already. Like Uncle Bob&#8217;s Clean Code. Like Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. What makes your code understandable to others. Is it Comments? No. It&#8217;s not comments. If your code could be read properly you wouldn&#8217;t need comments to explain what it does. Like Uncle Bob said. A good code doesn&#8217;t contain surprises.

            	Hello chumps. Today I want to write about jms connection testing with a small framework. I wrote a small thing using a factory object model. It&#8217;s a lead, a proof of concept. You can use this to go onward. First, let&#8217;s begin with the JMS connection it self. JMS Connection First rule of thumb is: &#8220;Don&#8217;t wait for a response when dealing with JMS queues.&#8221; How so? Because, a JMS queue is asynchronous so you wont get back anything.

            	When I see something like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 public class Config &#123; public static final string DATABASELINK = "linkhere"; . . . &#125; It sends a small, but chilling shiver down my spine. Just&#8230; don&#8217;t. There are a lot of possibilities to use configuration in Java. Java property files. Xml. Xml serialization. CSV file. Whatever suits you best, but this? DON&#8217;T!
