      <description>Hi Folks.
Ever used Job DSL plugin for Jenkins? What is that you say? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s TEH most awesome plug-in for Jenkins to have, because you can CODE your job configuration and put it under source control.
Today, however, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to write about that because the tutorials on Jenkins JOB DSL are very extensive and very well done. Anyone can pick them up.
Today, I would like to write about a part of it which is even more interesting.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Not a great many people know that I&amp;rsquo;m actually into Lock Picking as a hobby. This will not be a tutorial on how to do it, or I won&amp;rsquo;t really talk about how I do it; I would like to write about something completely different. So if you came here for that, here are a few very good resources:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi,
This time I would like to write about something that interests me. I wanted to try out a pure JavaScript web framework.
My choice is: Meteor. Looks interesting enough and it was recommended by a friend of mine. So, let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.
Installation As always, one starts with installation. The page tells us to follow this simple step:
1  curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh   Easy enough, when you are on Linux.</description>

      <description>Hi Folks!
I just wanted to share with you my mind map on the seven principles of Context Driven Testing.
I used the notion of dragons since it&amp;rsquo;s seven. And a dragon is usually seven headed in my mind.
So without further ado.
Click for larger image.
I have a hand drawn as well but I&amp;rsquo;m guessing that one wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be of much use since it follows my own imagination.</description>

      <description>Hello Everybody.
Today I would like to write a few words about Chrome&amp;rsquo;s Search Engines.
You&amp;rsquo;re probably already using it for a couple of things, like Google, or Amazon searches or YouTube or anything like that. But are you using it to access environments and testing tools faster, with queries?
For example, here is a quick Jira Search made easy:
Keyword: jira
URL: https://atlas.projectname.com/jira/browse/PROJECT-%s
So just type: jira|space|9999
Will immediately bring you to your ticket.</description>

      <title>How to write a blog – Why long posts rarely work</title>

      <description>Hello.
So let&amp;rsquo;s clarify this. They rarely or ever work if you are a beginner blogger. If you have a reputation it will probably work or people will use it as a reference. But I&amp;rsquo;m skipping ahead.
Beginnings
When you are a beginner blog writer you want to get out as much content as possible. Write mostly relevant things and interesting information because you need to establish a name for yourself.</description>

      <title>How to check content header on unknown number of items – Python</title>

      <description>Hello guys.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to share a little something with you. It&amp;rsquo;s what I cooked up in Python to check an unknown number of content items in a web application.
Basically the script runs from a script folder under Grails. It goes through all the configured folders where there is static content like images, javascript, css and so on and so forth.
And then with curl it calls these items up in using their respective paths&#39;.</description>

      <description>Hello.
Today I would like to write about something very interesting to you folks.
It&amp;rsquo;s a common remember / recall technique called the Method of loci. Otherwise known as the Memory Palace. A very popular usage can be seen in the episodes of Sherlock Holmes from BBC. He uses it often.
What is the Method of loci?
As the Wikipedia page write so properly.&amp;ldquo;In basic terms, it is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information.</description>

      <title>Why you should learn using Vim</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2014/02/10/why-you-should-learn-using-vim/</link>

      <description>Hello,
So Vim is a very powerful editing tool and has lots and lots of potential in regarding plug-ins.
It has years and years of gathered knowledge and extensions and can virtually do anything you want. But that&amp;rsquo;s not even it&amp;rsquo;s final form.
The real power of Vim lies in navigation and manipulation. The ability to navigate and edit without the use of arrow keys or mouse chops of a large portion of your time which you didn&amp;rsquo;t even realize you are wasting until you try it without it.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to share today something with all of you. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how technology affected my life in the long run. And how I perceive the world today around me. So let&amp;rsquo;s go around this topic for a little bit shall we?
The Past
So as somebody who lived for a while without technology coming near family for a decade or so I have a little bit of past in me without smart phones, gadgets, tv or computers for that matter.</description>
