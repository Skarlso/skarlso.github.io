      <description>Hi Folks.
Ever used Job DSL pluginfor Jenkins? What is that you say? Well, it’s TEH most awesome plug-in for Jenkins to have, because you can CODE your job configuration and put it under source control.
Today, however, I’m not going to write about that because the tutorials on Jenkins JOB DSL are very extensive and very well done. Anyone can pick them up.
Today, I would like to write about a part of it which is even more interesting.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Not a great many people know that I’m actually into Lock Picking as a hobby. This will not be a tutorial on how to do it, or I won’t really talk about how I do it; I would like to write about something completely different. So if you came here for that, here are a few very good resources:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time I would like to write about something that interests me. I wanted to try out a pure JavaScript web framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My choice is: &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;Meteor&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;. Looks interesting enough and it was recommended by a friend of mine. So, let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to share with you my mind map on the seven principles of Context Driven Testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used the notion of dragons since it’s seven. And a dragon is usually seven headed in my mind…&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to write a few words about Chrome’s Search Engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’re probably already using it for a couple of things, like Google, or Amazon searches or YouTube or anything like that. But are you using it to access environments and testing tools faster, with queries?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hello.
So let’s clarify this… They rarely or ever work if you are a beginner blogger. If you have a reputation it will probably work or people will use it as a reference. But I’m skipping ahead.
Beginnings
When you are a beginner blog writer you want to get out as much content as possible. Write mostly relevant things and interesting information because you need to establish a name for yourself.</description>

      <description>Hello guys.
I’d like to share a little something with you. It’s what I cooked up in Python to check an unknown number of content items in a web application.
Basically the script runs from a script folder under Grails. It goes through all the configured folders where there is static content like images, javascript, css and so on and so forth.
And then with curl it calls these items up in using their respective paths’.</description>

      <description>Hello.
Today I would like to write about something very interesting to you folks.
It’s a common remember / recall technique called the Method of loci. Otherwise known as the Memory Palace. A very popular usage can be seen in the episodes of Sherlock Holmes from BBC. He uses it often.
What is the Method of loci?
As the Wikipedia page write so properly…”In basic terms, it is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information.</description>

      <title>Why you should learn using Vim</title>

      <guid>https://skarlso.github.io/2014/02/10/why-you-should-learn-using-vim/</guid>
      <description>Hello,
So Vim is a very powerful editing tool and has lots and lots of potential in regarding plug-ins.
It has years and years of gathered knowledge and extensions and can virtually do anything you want. But that’s not even it’s final form…
The real power of Vim lies in navigation and manipulation. The ability to navigate and edit without the use of arrow keys or mouse chops of a large portion of your time which you didn’t even realize you are wasting until you try it without it.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
I’d like to share today something with all of you. I’ve been thinking about how technology affected my life in the long run. And how I perceive the world today around me. So let’s go around this topic for a little bit shall we?
The Past
So as somebody who lived for a while without technology coming near family for a decade or so I have a little bit of past in me without smart phones, gadgets, tv or computers for that matter.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
I attended a 4 day course of Groovy and Grails and this is my attempt at writing up a summary to see how much I retained. I’ll try to do this from the top of my head without peaking at my notes.
So let’s begin.
Introductions
First of all, introductions. The course was held by Peter Ledbrook. He is the guy who wrote Grails in Action. He is awesome, go check him out.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today I’d like to share with you some of the experiences I had as a beginner tester. I hope it sets you off on a path to enlightenment and leaves you off with a good appetite for testing. Shall we begin then?
The early days
It was 2004 when I finished school and started working at my first company. I finished as a software developer which is kind of an exaggeration since I only finished a 2 years course of it.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody.
Today I would like to write about something I experienced over the years of being in the software industry.
Some History
I’ve been a tester for a long time now. I’ve been up and down and down and up. I struggled for a very long time until I became somebody who I am today. And I still have many things to learn ahead of me.
I learned from many people.</description>

      <description>Hello Everybody.
Today I would like to show you what you need to become a Testing expert.
If you had noticed I deliberately left out the word Software. Why? Because becoming and expert in Testing Anything has the same root as becoming an expert to test software. And for that let me take you back to a Galaxy Far Far Away in Time AND Space.
The beginnings…
I went to school in Oroszlany, my home town in Hungary.</description>

      <description>Dear Readers.
Today I want to talk to you about something I discovered over years of working and experience.
Also something that I can see in the world repeating over and over again. Not just in Software business but also in History in Human nature in Physics and Systems.
So let’s see what I’m talking about.
What is Chaos?
Chaos is a state of utter confusion. Chaos is the opposite of order.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody.
Today I’d like to write about something I discovered over the years of researching and following certain people and movements in Testing and Programming world.
Let me tell you that there are quite an amazing amount of stuff to be read out there. It’s overwhelming.
Let’s talk about Methodologies first.
There are many out there currently. In programming and in testing too. Many speak of ways how you should or should not do you work.</description>

      <description>Hello Everybody.
I’d like to introduce T.E.A.S. to you. This is something I came up with yesterday which requires a lot of fantasy some good thinking planning and enthusiastic people. So, let’s get started.
What is it about?
Testing Exploration Adventure Session is about… Testing! There. No real surprise, eh? TEAS has it’s roots in RPGs. Role Playing Games. If you ever heard or read about M.A.G.U.S. or the more known Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons you will have a better understanding of the concept behind this phenomena.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today I want to write about a little trick I learned.
If you are working with legacy code and you don’t have the chance to eliminate core design problems, you can use this little pattern to help you out.
Problem
Problem is that you have a class that has a gazillion collaborators and at some point in time one of the clever devs thought it would be a cool idea to do dependancy injection via the constructor.</description>
