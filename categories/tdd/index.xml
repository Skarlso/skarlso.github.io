      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is TDD dead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really. So let’s talk about this topic for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you already read a gazillion posts about this debate but frankly I’m writing this for myself, to rant a little bit, you know… Because somebody is wrong on the internet and I must intervene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hello everybody.
So yesterday I was on a little gathering called Coderetreat.
If you look at the link you can read everything about it. If not, I’ve provided a short description.
What it is about?
So what is codereatreat about? In short it’s about programmers getting together and honing and practicing there skills in order to become more at what they are doing. It’s a practice run with great people. TDDing one problem the whole day long with constantly applied constraints.</description>

      <description>So today at 8-12PM I had a great session with two friends of mine. It was awesome. Like a mini code retreat.
We set down in a musky bar, drank wine and beer and cider, and decided to practice some TDD with the well known problem of Conway’s Game of Life. This challenge is really interesting. I never done it before, ever. So it was a really good practice for me.</description>
