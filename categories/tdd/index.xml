      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is TDD dead?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not really. So let&amp;#8217;s talk about this topic for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m sure you already read a gazillion posts about this debate but frankly I&amp;#8217;m writing this for myself, to rant a little bit, you know&amp;#8230; Because somebody is wrong on the internet and I must intervene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hello everybody.
So yesterday I was on a little gathering called Coderetreat.
If you look at the link you can read everything about it. If not, I&amp;#8217;ve provided a short description.
What it is about?
So what is codereatreat about? In short it&amp;#8217;s about programmers getting together and honing and practicing there skills in order to become more at what they are doing. It&amp;#8217;s a practice run with great people. TDDing one problem the whole day long with constantly applied constraints.</description>

      <description>So today at 8-12PM I had a great session with two friends of mine. It was awesome. Like a mini code retreat.
We set down in a musky bar, drank wine and beer and cider, and decided to practice some TDD with the well known problem of Conway&amp;#8217;s Game of Life. This challenge is really interesting. I never done it before, ever. So it was a really good practice for me.</description>
