      <description>Intro Good afternoon folks.
Today, I would like to talk a little bit about Cronohub. It&amp;rsquo;s a Python application which you can use to archive anything from anywhere to anywhere. It uses plugins to archive this versatility.
Let me show you some of its features.
Main Usage Cronohub is a python application which uses the power and ease of usage of Python to give the user a framework. This Framework can then be used to implement concrete functionality in the form of plugins.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
A small update to this. I created the model now, which is the database design for this app. It’s very simple, nothing fancy. Also, I’m writing the app with Python 3 from now on.
Here is the model now:
Worth noting a few things here. The __str__ is only with Python 3. In Python 2 it would be unicode. And the OneToOne and the foreign key are automatically using Primary keys defined in the references model.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing where we left off with the Django RPG project. Next up is implementing a rudimentary registration and adding the ability to create a character. Maybe even, design the database through django’s modelling.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So last time, we tried to implement a little RPG of mine using Meteor, which failed miserably. This time we are going to try and use Django. Let’s have at it, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
Just a small script which calculates your distance from a lever focal point if you know your weight, the object’s weight and the object’s and the distance the object has from the focal point of the lever.
Like this:
This script will give you D1. And this is how it will look like in doing so:
So, in order for me (77kg) to lift an object of 80kg which is on a, by default, 1 meter long lever, I have to stand back ~1.</description>

      <description>Let’s talk about plans. It’s good to have one. For example, I have a plan for this year.
I kind of like math. So, I have this book:
It’s 1400 pages long and basically, has everything in it. It’s a rather exhaustive book. Hence, my plan is to finish the book by the end of 2015 and write a couple of python scripts that calculate something interesting.
For example, Newton’s law of cooling how I learned it is:</description>
