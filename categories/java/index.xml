      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to write about something interesting and close to me at the moment. I&amp;#8217;m going to setup Go.cd with Docker, and I&amp;#8217;m going to get a Ruby Lotus app running. Let&amp;#8217;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hey folks.
I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day.
If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It&amp;#8217;s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know&amp;#8230; It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.</description>

      <title>Cucumber Test Name and Tags on Feature</title>

      <description>Hello everybody.
I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.
Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm
You can try something like that:
  @After //this is cucumbers @Afters public static void afterExecution&amp;#40;Scenario scenario&amp;#41; &amp;#123; logger.log&amp;#40;&#34;The status of the test is: &#34; + scenario.getStatus&amp;#40;&amp;#41;&amp;#41;; &amp;#125;     But that isn&amp;#8217;t giving you too much now is it?</description>

      <title>How to eliminate a parameter boom</title>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today I want to write about a little trick I learned.
If you are working with legacy code and you don&amp;#8217;t have the chance to eliminate core design problems, you can use this little pattern to help you out.
Problem
Problem is that you have a class that has a gazillion collaborators and at some point in time one of the clever devs thought it would be a cool idea to do dependancy injection via the constructor.</description>

      <description>So today at 8-12PM I had a great session with two friends of mine. It was awesome. Like a mini code retreat.
We set down in a musky bar, drank wine and beer and cider, and decided to practice some TDD with the well known problem of Conway&amp;#8217;s Game of Life. This challenge is really interesting. I never done it before, ever. So it was a really good practice for me.</description>

      <description>My solution to the String Wrap Kata. The goal is to have it wrap a text on a given column width.
It is not the best solution but this is my first try. I did it with TDD so there were tests first, which I&amp;#8217;m not going to copy in..
  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37   &amp;nbsp; public class WrapKata &amp;#123; &amp;nbsp; public String wrap&amp;#40;String input, int columnSize&amp;#41; &amp;#123; &amp;nbsp; if &amp;#40;input.</description>

      <description>Hi.
Today I want to talk about a common problem in many frameworks I encountered over the course of my carrier as a Java dev / automation engineer, whatnot.
Throwing Exceptions. That is in your method you have something like this:
  1   public void insertMethodNameHere&amp;#40;String param&amp;#41; throws Exception &amp;#123;&amp;#125;     This is bad. And I will tell you in short forms why.

      <description>Hello chumps.
Today I want to write about jms connection testing with a small framework. I wrote a small thing using a factory object model. It&amp;#8217;s a lead, a proof of concept. You can use this to go onward.
First, let&amp;#8217;s begin with the JMS connection it self.
JMS Connection
First rule of thumb is: &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t wait for a response when dealing with JMS queues.&amp;#8221; How so? Because, a JMS queue is asynchronous so you wont get back anything.</description>
