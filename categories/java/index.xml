      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to write about something interesting and close to me at the moment. I&amp;#8217;m going to setup Go.cd with Docker, and I&amp;#8217;m going to get a Ruby Lotus app running. Let&amp;#8217;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick post about an interesting idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to elaborate on a possibility to use the Strategy Design pattern.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hey folks.
I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day.
If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It&amp;#8217;s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know&amp;#8230; It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.</description>

      <title>Cucumber Test Name and Tags on Feature</title>

      <description>Hello everybody.
I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.
Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm
You can try something like that:
  @After //this is cucumbers @Afters public static void afterExecution&amp;#40;Scenario scenario&amp;#41; &amp;#123; logger.log&amp;#40;&#34;The status of the test is: &#34; + scenario.getStatus&amp;#40;&amp;#41;&amp;#41;; &amp;#125;     But that isn&amp;#8217;t giving you too much now is it?</description>

      <title>How to eliminate a parameter boom</title>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today I want to write about a little trick I learned.
If you are working with legacy code and you don&amp;#8217;t have the chance to eliminate core design problems, you can use this little pattern to help you out.
Problem
Problem is that you have a class that has a gazillion collaborators and at some point in time one of the clever devs thought it would be a cool idea to do dependancy injection via the constructor.</description>
