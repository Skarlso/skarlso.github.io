      <description>Hello dear reader.
I switched to a new theme that has Dark Mode. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping nothing changed regarding the RSS functionality.
I removed the comments because I rarely used them.
Also disabled any sort of tracking.
Enjoy, Gergely.</description>

      <description>Welcome dear reader.
When last we met, we talked a lot about setting up Tilt for rapid controller development.
Now, let&amp;rsquo;s see how powerful Tilt can be once we bring it together with Kubernetes&amp;rsquo; e2e-framework.
Controller E2E Framework I&amp;rsquo;d like to present my controller-e2e-framework which brings Tilt and e2e-framework together to easily write and run tests for controllers that work together.
This framework can be used to integration test or e2e test controllers that work together.</description>

      <description>Welcome dear reader.
Today, we are going to dive into how to use Tilt to speed up the feedback loop of developing a Kubernetes controller. We are going to do that using an open-source project called OCM which has a controller called ocm-controller. I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk through the following process:

This one is a quick update. Just a showcase really.
I wrote a tool to generate a sample YAML file from a CRD.

      <description>Hello!
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on something extensive these days. Like my Grokking Algorithms summary, I now moved on to read Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms.
As with Grokking, I created a Go based repo and added notes for each chapter.
The repo can be located here.

      <description>How to contribute to a new repository Hello Dear readers.
Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through a process of contributing into a new repository. If you are new to Go development and would like to contribute somewhere but are at a loss in large repositories, this post will be for you.
I selected the top repository in trending Go today. Which is istio. I think that&amp;rsquo;s sufficiently large and I have no idea about the repository, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to walk you through my process.</description>

      <description>Hello Dear readers.
Today, I would like to write about a small pet project of mine called Dependabot Bundler.
We&amp;rsquo;ve all been here:
You would like to review these individually, of course, however, having to individually merge them is quite the pain.
Isn&amp;rsquo;t it a lot better to do this instead?
A lot nicer and more comfortable, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
This is done by running dependabot-bundler with the following command:
./bundler --token ${GITHUB_TOKEN} --repo eksctl --owner weaveworks --author-name Skarlso --author-email gergely@weave.</description>

      <description>Intro Hi folks!
Today I would like to write about a metric that I read in a book called Clean Architecture from Robert Cecil Martin ( Uncle Bob ).
Abstract The metrics I mean are Efferent and Afferent coupling in packages. So you, dear reader, don&amp;rsquo;t have to navigate away from this page, here are the descriptions pasted in:
Afferent couplings (Ca): The number of classes in other packages that depend upon classes within the package is an indicator of the package&amp;rsquo;s responsibility.</description>

      <description>Intro Alright folks. Settle in and get comfortable. This is going to be a long, but hopefully, fun ride.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to deploy a distributed application with Kubernetes. I attempted to create an application that I thought resembled a real world app. Obviously I had to cut some corners due to time and energy constraints.
My focus will be on Kubernetes and deployment.
Shall we delve right in?
The Application TL;DR The application itself consists of six parts.</description>

      <description>Intro So I was at Go Budapest Meetup yesterday, where the brilliant Johan Brandhorst gave a talk about his project based on gRPC using gRPC-web + GopherJS + protobuf. He also has some Go contributions and check out his project here: Protobuf. It&amp;rsquo;s GopherJS Bindings for ProtobufJS and gRPC-Web.
It was interesting to see where these projects could lead and I see the potential in them. I liked the usage of Protobuf and gRPC, I don&amp;rsquo;t have THAT much experience with them.</description>

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
In the past couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly updating Furnace.
There are three major changes that happened. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at them, shall we?
Google Cloud Platform Furnace now supports Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides the same API to handle GCP resource as with AWS. Namely, create, delete, status, update. I opted to leave out push because Google mostly works with git based repositories, meaning a push is literary just a push, than Google handles distributing the new code by itself.</description>

      <description>Intro Hi All.
Today I would like to write about an AWS finger practice.
Previously, I wrote about how I build and deploy my blog with Wercker. Since, I&amp;rsquo;m a cloud engineer and I dislike Oracle and it&amp;rsquo;s ever expending tenctacles into the abyss, I wanted to switch to use something else.
My build and deploy cycle is simple.

Quick note. Furnace now comes pre-compiled easy to access binaries which you can download and use out of the box.
No need to install anything, or compile the source. Just download, unzip and use.

This is a follow up on my previous post about Google Sign-In. In this post we will discover what to do with the information retrieved in the first encounter, which you can find here: Google Sign-In Part 1.
Forewords The Project Everything I did in the first post, and that I&amp;rsquo;m going to do in this example, can be found in this project: Google-OAuth-Go-Sample.
Just to recap, we left off previously on the point where we successfully obtained information about the user, with a secure token and a session initiated with them.</description>

      <description>Hi Folks.
So Wercker was not working. After a minor modification it seems to be okay now. The config file needed for it to work looks like this:
box: golang build: steps: - arjen/hugo-build: theme: redlounge deploy: steps: - install-packages: packages: git - leipert/git-push: gh_oauth: $GIT_TOKEN repo: skarlso/skarlso.github.io branch: master basedir: public The modification is the box type to golang and removed ssh-client from packages.

      <description>Basics Hello folks.
This will be a quick post about how to do CORS with jQuery, Gin in Go with a very simple ajax GET and Json.
I&amp;rsquo;m choosing JSON here because basically I don&amp;rsquo;t really like JSONP. And actually, it&amp;rsquo;s not very complicated to do CORS, it&amp;rsquo;s just hidden enough so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t become transparent.
First, what is CORS? It&amp;rsquo;s Cross-Platform Resource Sharing. It has been invented so that without your explicit authorization in the header of a request, Javascript can&amp;rsquo;t reach outside of your domain and be potentially harmful to your visitors.</description>

I wanted to share with you my tale of working through the problems with Advent Of Code.
It is a nice tale and there are a few things I learned from it, especially in Go, since I used that solve all of the problems. So, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
Solving the problems The most important lesson I learned while doing these exercises was, how to solve these problems. A couple of them were simple enough to not have to over think it, but most of them got very tricky.</description>

      <description>Hi folks and a Happy new Year!
Today, I would like to show you some interesting things you can do with channels. Consider the following simple example.
package main import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; func main() { generatedPassword := make(chan int, 100) correctPassword := make(chan int) defer close(generatedPassword) defer close(correctPassword) go passwordIncrement(generatedPassword) go checkPassword(generatedPassword, correctPassword) pass := &amp;lt;-correctPassword fmt.Println(pass) } func checkPassword(input &amp;lt;-chan int, output chan&amp;lt;- int) { for { p := &amp;lt;-input //Introduce lengthy operation here // time.</description>

      <description>Hello Folks.
This is just a quick post on the topic and a reminder for myself and everybody to ALWAYS USE []BYTE INSTEAD OF STRINGS.
[]Byte is marginally faster than a simple Strings. In fact, I would say using []byte should be the standard instead of strings.
Sample code:
package solutions import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; const ( //INPUT input INPUT = &amp;#34;1321131112&amp;#34; //LIMIT limit LIMIT = 50 ) //LookAndSay translates numbers according to Look and Say algo func LookAndSay(s string, c chan string) { charCount := 1 look := &amp;#34;&amp;#34; for i := range s { if i+1 &amp;lt; len(s) { if s[i] == s[i+1] { charCount++ } else { look += fmt.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody!
I wanted to do a sort post about word frequency count. I did it many times now and I was curious as how a recursive solution would perform as opposed to looping.
So I wrote it up quickly and added a few benchmarks with different sized data.
First&amp;hellip;. The code:
var freqMap = make(map[string]int, 0) func countLettersRecursive(s string) string { if len(s) == 0 { return s } freqMap[string(s[0])]++ return countLettersRecursive(s[1:]) } func countLettersLoop(s string) { for _, v := range s { freqMap[string(v)]++ } } Very simple.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Here is a little something I&amp;rsquo;ve put together, since I&amp;rsquo;m doing it a lot.
Go Development Environment
If I have a project I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute, like GoHugo, I have to setup a development environment, because most of the times, I&amp;rsquo;m on a Mac. And on OSX things work differently. I like to work in a Linux environment since that&amp;rsquo;s what most of the projects are built on.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
So, I was playing around and created a client for JIRA written in Go. It was nice to do some JSON transformation. And sending POSTS was really trivial.
It&amp;rsquo;s still in it&amp;rsquo;s infancy and I have a couple of more features I want to implement, but, here is the code.
package main import ( &amp;#34;bytes&amp;#34; &amp;#34;encoding/json&amp;#34; &amp;#34;flag&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;io/ioutil&amp;#34; &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; &amp;#34;net/http&amp;#34; &amp;#34;os&amp;#34; &amp;#34;github.com/BurntSushi/toml&amp;#34; ) var configFile = &amp;#34;~/.jira_config.toml&amp;#34; var parameter string var flags struct { Comment string Description string IssueKey string Priority string Resolution string Title string Project string } //Issue is a representation of a Jira Issue type Issue struct { Fields struct { Project struct { Key string `json:&amp;#34;key&amp;#34;` } `json:&amp;#34;project&amp;#34;` Summary string `json:&amp;#34;summary&amp;#34;` Description string `json:&amp;#34;description&amp;#34;` Issuetype struct { Name string `json:&amp;#34;name&amp;#34;` } `json:&amp;#34;issuetype&amp;#34;` Priority struct { ID string `json:&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;` } `json:&amp;#34;priority&amp;#34;` } `json:&amp;#34;fields&amp;#34;` } //Transition defines a transition json object.</description>

      <description>Hi Folks.
I started to build a Progress Quest type of web app in Go.
If you&amp;rsquo;d like to join, or just tag along, please drop by here =&amp;gt; Go Progress Quest and feel free to submit an issue if you have an idea, or would like to contribute!
I will try and document the Progress.
Thank you for reading!

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud of this one too. No peaking. I like how go let&amp;rsquo;s you do this kind of stuff in a very nice way.
package circular import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; //TestVersion testVersion const TestVersion = 1 //Buffer buffer type type Buffer struct { buffer []byte full int size int s, e int } //NewBuffer creates a new Buffer func NewBuffer(size int) *Buffer { return &amp;amp;Buffer{buffer: make([]byte, size), s: 0, e: 0, size: size, full: 0} } //ReadByte reads a byte from b Buffer func (b *Buffer) ReadByte() (byte, error) { if b.</description>

      <description>Quickly wrote up the Data Munger code kata in Go.
Next time, I want better abstractions. And a way to select columns based on their header data. For now, this is not bad.
package main import ( &amp;#34;bufio&amp;#34; &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;log&amp;#34; &amp;#34;math&amp;#34; &amp;#34;os&amp;#34; &amp;#34;regexp&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strconv&amp;#34; &amp;#34;strings&amp;#34; ) //Data which is Data type Data struct { columnName string compareOne float64 compareTwo float64 } func main() { // datas := []Data{WeatherData{}, FootballData{}} fmt.Println(&amp;#34;Minimum weather data:&amp;#34;, GetDataMinimumDiff(&amp;#34;weather.</description>
