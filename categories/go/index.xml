      <description>Intro Hi folks!
Today I would like to write about a metric that I read in a book called Clean Architecture from Robert Cecil Martin ( Uncle Bob ).
Abstract The metrics I mean are Efferent and Afferent coupling in packages. So you, dear reader, don&amp;rsquo;t have to navigate away from this page, here are the descriptions pasted in:
  Afferent couplings (Ca): The number of classes in other packages that depend upon classes within the package is an indicator of the package&amp;rsquo;s responsibility.</description>

      <title>Go SSH with Host Key Verification</title>

      <description>Hi folks.
Following a long search and reading lots of debates and possibilities of doing SSH within Go, I was shocked to see that not a great many tools and people use SSH with host key verification. What I usually see is this:
HostKeyCallback: ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey() This is terrible. Now, I realise that doing HostKeyVerification can be tedious, but don&amp;rsquo;t fear. It&amp;rsquo;s actually easy now that the Go team provided the knownhosts subpackage in their crypto SSH package located here: KnownHosts.</description>

      <title>Kubernetes distributed application deployment with sample Face Recognition App</title>

      <description>Intro Alright folks. Settle in and get comfortable. This is going to be a long, but hopefully, fun ride.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to deploy a distributed application with Kubernetes. I attempted to create an application that I thought resembled a real world app. Obviously I had to cut some corners due to time and energy constraints.
My focus will be on Kubernetes and deployment.
Shall we delve right in?
The Application TL;DR The application itself consists of six parts.</description>

      <description>Intro So I was at Go Budapest Meetup yesterday, where the brilliant Johan Brandhorst gave a talk about his project based on gRPC using gRPC-web + GopherJS + protobuf. He also has some Go contributions and check out his project here: Protobuf. It&amp;rsquo;s GopherJS Bindings for ProtobufJS and gRPC-Web.
It was interesting to see where these projects could lead and I see the potential in them. I liked the usage of Protobuf and gRPC, I don&amp;rsquo;t have THAT much experience with them.</description>

      <title>Huge Furnace Update</title>

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
In the past couple of months I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly updating Furnace.
There are three major changes that happened. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at them, shall we?
Google Cloud Platform Furnace now supports Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides the same API to handle GCP resource as with AWS. Namely, create, delete, status, update. I opted to leave out push because Google mostly works with git based repositories, meaning a push is literary just a push, than Google handles distributing the new code by itself.</description>

      <description>Intro Hi All.
Today I would like to write about an AWS finger practice.
Previously, I wrote about how I build and deploy my blog with Wercker. Since, I&amp;rsquo;m a cloud engineer and I dislike Oracle and it&amp;rsquo;s ever expending tenctacles into the abyss, I wanted to switch to use something else.
My build and deploy cycle is simple.
Commit to Blogsource Repo -&amp;gt; Wercker WebHook -&amp;gt; Builds my blog using Hugo -&amp;gt; Pushed to a Different Repository which my Github Blog.</description>
