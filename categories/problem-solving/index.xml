      <description>Hi folks.
If you have the tendency, like me, to forget that you are on the corporate VPN, or leave a certain software open when you bring your laptop to work, this might be helpful to you too.
It’s a small script which kills a program when you change your Wifi network.
Script:
Now, the trick is, on OSX to only trigger this when your network changes. For this, you can have a ‘launchd’ daemon, which is configured to watch three files which relate to a network being changed.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m proud of this one too. No peaking. I like how go let&amp;rsquo;s you do this kind of stuff in a very nice way.
package circular import &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; //TestVersion testVersion const TestVersion = 1 //Buffer buffer type type Buffer struct { buffer []byte full int size int s, e int } //NewBuffer creates a new Buffer func NewBuffer(size int) *Buffer { return &amp;amp;Buffer{buffer: make([]byte, size), s: 0, e: 0, size: size, full: 0} } //ReadByte reads a byte from b Buffer func (b *Buffer) ReadByte() (byte, error) { if b.</description>

Next time, I want better abstractions. And a way to select columns based on their header data. For now, this is not bad.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today, I would like to talk about something I came in contact with, and was hard to find a proper answer / solution for it.
So I’m writing this down to document my findings. Like the title says, this is about aggregating test result with Jenkins, using the plug-in provided. If you, like me, have a pipeline structure which do not work on the same artifact, but do have a upstream-downstream relationship, you will have a hard time configuring and making Aggregation work.</description>

      <title>Quick Tip for Debugging Headless Locally</title>

      <description>If you are installing something with Packer and you have Headless enabled(and you are lazy and don’t want to switch it off), it gets difficult, to see output.
Especially on a windows install the Answer File / Unattended install can be like =&amp;gt; Waiting for SSH… for about an hour or two! If you are doing this locally fret not. Just start VirtualBox, and watch the Preview section which will display the current state even if it’s a headless install!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, recently, the tester team talked to me, that their build takes too long, and why is that? A quick look at their configuration and build scripts showed me, that they are actually using a vagrant box, which never gets destroyed or re-started at least. To remedy this problem, I came up with the following solution…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Packer 0.8.1.</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2015/07/01/packer-0-8-1/</link>

      <guid>https://skarlso.github.io/2015/07/01/packer-0-8-1/</guid>
      <description>Previously I wrote that the scripts I’m writing, are failing because Packer hangs.
Apparently, this was a known issue. And apparently, I was using an older version, 0.7.5. After I updated everything is working wonderfully!!!
And for my thanks, here is an updated PowerShell script for provisioning my dotnet stuff.
Thanks for reading!

      <description>Hello folks.
Today, I would like to show you a small script. It installs Java JDK, both version, x86 and 64 bit, silently, and wait for that process to finish.
The wait is necessary because /s on a java install has the nasty habit of running in the background. If you are using a .bat file, you shouldn’t, than you would use something like: start /w jdk-setup.exe /s. This gets it done, but is ugly.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to write about something close to my heart recently. I’ve been fiddling with Packer, Windows and Vagrant these days. Trying to get a Windows box up in running is a pain in the arse though, so I thought I share my pain with you nice folks out there. Let’s begin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hello guys.
I’d like to share a little something with you. It’s what I cooked up in Python to check an unknown number of content items in a web application.
Basically the script runs from a script folder under Grails. It goes through all the configured folders where there is static content like images, javascript, css and so on and so forth.
And then with curl it calls these items up in using their respective paths’.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody.
I’d like to explain a lot about a topic that is very near my heart. If your job is in an office you will understand this.
Why offices?
So why are we sitting together in one big place cramped up with 20-300 other people? Why bother the catering and the ventilation and what not to accommodate these people at one place? Why not just leave them be and let them work at home?</description>

      <description>Hello everybody. I’ve been messing around with sublime for some time now. And been using it to write entires and stuff. So here I was thinking why the hell I should not us it as my main blog entry writer. And being the curious guy I was I thought that creating a plugin that let’s you submit your post from your favorite editor is just the thing I need.
So without any further ado here it is… The wordpress blog entry submitter plugin for sublime text: Sublime WordPress PluginPlease enjoy.</description>

      <description>Hey folks.
I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day.
If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It’s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know… It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.</description>

I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.
Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm
You can try something like that:
But that isn’t giving you too much now is it? And the API of scenario is as small as it can get. It offers you four options:

Today I would like to write about something I experienced over the years of being in the software industry.
Some History
I’ve been a tester for a long time now. I’ve been up and down and down and up. I struggled for a very long time until I became somebody who I am today. And I still have many things to learn ahead of me.
I learned from many people.</description>

      <description>Dear Readers.
Today I want to talk to you about something I discovered over years of working and experience.
Also something that I can see in the world repeating over and over again. Not just in Software business but also in History in Human nature in Physics and Systems.
So let’s see what I’m talking about.
What is Chaos?
Chaos is a state of utter confusion. Chaos is the opposite of order.</description>
