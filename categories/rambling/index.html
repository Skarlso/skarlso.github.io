                        <p>I used to have great ideas on the toilet, but I no longer do. And I would like to reflect on that. So this is not going to be a technical post, rather some ramblings.</p>

<p>I already had a post similar to this one, but I failed to follow up on it, and now I&#8217;m re-visiting the question. With technology on the rise, embedded systems, chips, augmented biology and information being available at our fingertips, I have but one concern. I don&#8217;t want to sound like an old guy reflecting on history, that now everything is changing and that we need to have a sight on the past and bla bla bla. I do have one valid concern though. We are in danger of loosing ourselves.</p>

<p>With mobile phones and the Internet always being around and available, we are in danger of loosing our thoughts and ideas, our individuality and our THINKING. We are reading news, posts, advancements, blogs, vlogs, and the dreaded 9gag. I am one of these people. I read 9gag. And I hate myself for it. It&#8217;s an immediate satisfaction and gain of euphoria and a way of shutting my brain down when it needs it. But I caught myself doing it one or more times when I should have read something more important or beneficial at least. Or catch up on a blog post or read a news, or Gods forbid just plain sit around and THINK for a little while.</p>

<p>So my previous post around this topic was to leave out technology from your life&#8217;s for a short period of time. This is the same. Have some alone time. Reflect. Write a diary. If you are a technical person, write down ideas you would want to create. If you don&#8217;t have any, write out bigger ones. For example, I want to write an RPG. Or That I want to learn how to do metaprogramming the proper way. Or that I want to read up on some Russian sciences fiction. There are SOOOO many things in the world. Don&#8217;t waste it on bullshit and immediate serotonin generating content, like frigging cats! When you do it, when your are at it, stop for a little bit, and think. <strong>THINK</strong>. What are you doing? Why are you reading up on that crap? What merit does it have?</p>

<p>I understand that from time to time you need to shut off. You need a little bit of comfort. A little bit of serotonin in your system. There are better ways of achieving that. Go for a walk. Run. Bike. Eat a chocolate while staring out of a window. Read a comic book. Do random acts of kindness (not kidding). Drink a glass of water. Listen to some awesome music while drawing something ( anything, it doesn&#8217;t have to be a masterpiece! ). Sit back and listen to some music. Talk to a loved one. Talk to a friend. Talk to yourself (again, not kidding). If you have a pet, go play with it.</p>

<p>So I have a little challenge here as well -it would be a reflective post if I didn&#8217;t have any-, do not bring any electronic devices to the toilet. Or if you bring one, the rule is to turn on Airplane mode. I used to have great ideas on the toilet because I didn&#8217;t used to watch stuff on my phone. I used to be by myself with my thoughts. I have a family so there is very little time or space to be alone and with my thoughts. And then when I had the chance, I was browsing on my phone, which again, effectively, led to not being alone with my thoughts.</p>

<p>There you have it. This is my little rant about technology and thinking.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve got a new job as a build engineer. As sort of a devops kind of guy. It&#8217;s extremely interesting considering that I made a career as a tester. Granted, I always was technical, and never really knew my path; but it seems my path is finding me after all.</p>

<p>In the past years, I got better at Docker, Puppet, Chef, AWS, Packer, Vagrant, Gradle, and a hell of a lot more.

I already read many books about devops but this time, it&#8217;s different. This time, I can actually do these things as well in a live environment.</p>

<p>As once a friend of mine told me: &#8220;You ain&#8217;t gonna learn anything unless you are getting payed for it.&#8221; Wise words. True words.</p>

<p>So stayed tuned for some devops and engineering type posts. I would like to continue working on the Django parts as well, however given my priorities and lack of time ( family and stuff, must choose what I learned in the hour I get each day), it might fall behind. I might stick it into some kind of provision practice or even give it a Travis.ci and put it into a gradle project. Now THAT&#8217;S interesting.</p>

                        <p>Is TDD dead?</p>

<p>Not really. So let&#8217;s talk about this topic for a little bit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you already read a gazillion posts about this debate but frankly I&#8217;m writing this for myself, to rant a little bit, you know&#8230; Because somebody is wrong on the internet and I must intervene.</p>

<p>So first of all, the hashtag #tddisdead (and I will use it shamelessly as well). This is clearly an attempt to get as many peoples attention as you can. TDD is NOT DEAD. Obviously since it has soooo many supporters how could it be dead? It&#8217;s like asking, is Design Patterns dead? Or is Functional Automation dead? Or is Oreo cookies dead?</p>

<p>No, it&#8217;s not dead. And it won&#8217;t ever be dead. It will maybe change into something new, something better even, but it will never be dead. So let&#8217;s skip that part.</p>

<p>Now, about the <strong>debate</strong>.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t hear so much bull spoken for this long since I watched the political debate of two fractions in my home country. The right wing extremists against the left wing&#8230;. I don&#8217;t know whats. And it was just that. A political debate. It had no merit and no value whatsoever. At all. Nothing.</p>

<p>And right in the middle <strong>DHH</strong> says this:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;you&#8217;re not done until you also have tests for a piece of functionality &#8212; I&#8217;m completely on board with that.&#8221;.</em></p>

<p>That made the whole conversation completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>Every counter against TDD I heard was <strong>bull</strong>. Not in that debate, in general. People are either too lazy to write them, just don&#8217;t want to get out of their comfort zone, don&#8217;t really care about tests, or don&#8217;t really care about quality or under time pressure ( I get to this later. ).</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<p><strong>Quality</strong></p>

<p>People seem to not care about quality that much. Would they, they would understand that having a bulletproof west will save your life when you get shot in the chest with a 357 magnum. You can flush out early design flaws you can detect early bugs and do a better system design.</p>

<p>Sure if you are the most intelligent man on the planet maybe you can come up with a perfect system on the first draft and then implement it flawlessly so that it doesn&#8217;t fall apart in two months time. But most people can&#8217;t. Most people make errors on the way.</p>

<p>And yes, writing tests can be hard. But guess what? If writing a test is hard because that part of the system is complicated, than it will be that part of the system which will react the worst to change. And only change is constant. Which brings me to the next item&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Time constraints</strong></p>

<p>So your manager is sitting right next to you and saying come on we are paying you to write code and not tests so do it! And you have to have a feature done today but if you write a suite of tests you&#8217;ll only finish tomorrow. Sure, your estimate at that point will become a very quick one because you make a sacrifice of trust.</p>

<p>And then the next story comes along and you say&#8230; <em>&#8220;Sure I can do that as well. No problem I know how my system works, right? Hmm&#8230; why the hell did that break all of a sudden? I didn&#8217;t change anything in that module&#8230; Ahh damn it I said I&#8217;ll be done today, so let&#8217;s just fix this quickly and then move on to the next card.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>And the next story comes along&#8230; <em>&#8220;Sure I can do that&#8230; wait a minute&#8230; Didn&#8217;t that part brake already twice? Damn, better refactor. Ohh shit, why is that now breaking???? Damn it I said I&#8217;ll be done tomorrow, better patch it, and then move on. Hmm let&#8217;s write a test here to make sure this does not break. Ohhh damn I need PowerMock for that stuff since it&#8217;s in another module. Why the hell is that there? Should it be here in the first place since it&#8217;s somehow used by that other class there? Interesting. Let&#8217;s refactor and put it in here so I can mock it. Ahhhh f*ck now all the rest of the system is not working. Damn, I&#8217;ll just use PowerMock. Shit. Checkstyle error. PowerMock is not allowed?? What?? Who the f*ck says that?&#8221;</em></p>

<p>You get my drift. And suddenly you end up with estimates of <strong>WEEKS</strong>!!!! instead of days / hours for a simple story.</p>

<p><strong>Finishing it up</strong></p>

<p>This a rant only. It&#8217;s my personal opinion, experience and observation of a 10 year time period in Software Testing. Starting with at least a Weak Skeleton and a few upfront tests will help you in the long run. Writing at least ONE &#8211; TWO acceptance tests WILL help you understand business logic better. Writing ONE or TWO unit tests will help you understand your logic better. I&#8217;m not saying write a whole damn suite of tests I can understand you don&#8217;t want to do that, but for quality&#8217;s sake write at least a couple.</p>

<p>You will love it, I promise you that.</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>Today I would like to tell you about a little conversation I had with my friend Adrian.</p>

<p>The topic was about how, when and what to log during a testing session regarding a story.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s see what came out of that talk&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Logging your work</strong></p>

<p>The question is really not whether you should log your work or not, but rather to what extend. Because we all know that you should log your work. It helps you recall and helps you organize and think out testing strategies. But the extend and methods are a big question. So here is my routine.</p>

<p><strong>Visually inclined</strong></p>

<p>I am a very visual person. I log my work with doodles and such like <a href="http://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/">Mr. Huib Schoots</a> who uses Sketchnote taking. You have seen some of my sketches if you follow my twitter feed, like this one =&gt; <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BAm6RSTCMAEvjas.jpg" alt="" />. You know I like to draw so for me colour and organizing and doodling is key to make a note more personalized and live.</p>

<p>That comes with a drawback. The draw back are many&#8230;</p>

<p>First of, I need to do that in a notebook. I could bring my wacoom tablet to work and draw in paint, but that wouldn&#8217;t be the same. And I don&#8217;t particularly like drawing on a tablet actually.</p>

<p>Second one, it&#8217;s completely unsearchable. As Adrian pointed out, you can&#8217;t search in a notebook, even if you are using side pointers like a sticky note or something. You won&#8217;t be able to instantly find and track down something you did. And after a while it gets cluttered with doodles and the notes are lost in-between. It will be very colourful and utterly useless.</p>

<p>Third one is, it&#8217;s slow. Typing is much faster.</p>

<p>On the bright side&#8230; I love doodling. And if I can draw something up with a picture I will understand it much faster rather then reading a few lines of words chunked together.</p>

<p>If I draw an awesome diagram I will get what&#8217;s going on much much faster.</p>

<p>And it will be more fun to actually right it down with a nice fountain pen with a beautiful tip that can create such marvels that you don&#8217;t want to put it down.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s portable. I can carry my notebook everywhere. I should be able to do the same with a laptop, but since it&#8217;s tied into a dock station and I don&#8217;t want to carry it around with myself everywhere I won&#8217;t do that. I could create notes though in my notebook and then write them down into the laptop after I&#8217;m done? Sure&#8230;</p>

<p>So now let&#8217;s go and see the other one.</p>

<p><strong>Electronic note-taking</strong></p>

<p>I think I already pointed out a few positives about that. It&#8217;s searchable. Definitely. It&#8217;s fast. Yes. It&#8217;s more convenient, more organized can be backed up and you won&#8217;t run out of ink or space or somebody won&#8217;t take it away to a meeting because &#8220;Ohh I saw it on your desk and I needed a paper hope that&#8217;s okay.&#8221;.</p>

<p>I understand the benefits of it. But it&#8217;s very very rigid. It has no colour, no personalization and no feeling whatsoever. It&#8217;s frigid, standardized and without life. So I need something to make it a bit better. I have a couple of tools for that.</p>

<p>First off I need a good graphics maker to create diagrams. There is an awesome free tool pointed out by Adrian to do that called <a href="http://www.yworks.com/en/products_download.php">yEd</a>. Download the zip and run the jar. I can live with that. Creates nice diagrams and flowcharts.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/swcdn5N.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s quite powerful. Go look it up. There are a gazillion picture on Ze internet.</p>

<p>But the notes still lack personalization. There are a couple of tools which you can use if you, like me, shy away from everything that&#8217;s Microsoft, you have the opportunity to use Emacs with the org plugin which makes absolutely amazing documents.</p>

<p><img src="http://dto.github.io/images/tutorial-11.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s awesome but the problem is that it will only work with Emacs and nothing else. And from time to time I don&#8217;t like the controls of Emacs. I&#8217;m a sublime text person. So recently I found a little plugin for sublime text called <a href="https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks">PlainTask</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how it can look like: <img src="http://www.nealsheeran.com/images/plaintasks.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I LOVE it. You can add little notes and set a task to complete or defer it and it sort of highlights and things like that, which I like. It&#8217;s still not doodling but it get&#8217;s the job done and will be searchable and will be fast and available. And you can use Sublime text&#8217;s awesome power of foldering. Create a root folder and open it with sublime. Then create one folder / story you are testing and put everything related to that story in that directory and then press CTRL+O and unleash the magic!</p>

<p>Instant search and organization at the power of your fingertips. Even search IN the files themselves.</p>

<p>This makes it a bit better and bearable. Which brings me to the final topic.</p>

<p><strong>Note taking frequency</strong></p>

<p>So my friend argued that he create a folder for EVERY story he ever tests. Even if it&#8217;s only one word he puts into it to as a memory trigger he does it. I argued that that seems to be a little too extensive. But he said in return, and I have to agree on that, that once you stop doing something because of an excuse like, ahh I don&#8217;t need to do it because it&#8217;s a small story, you will stop doing it completely. And this is actually true for everything in your life. And as somebody who recently started running ( 1 month ago ) I understand the weight of that sentence very well.</p>

<p>So I would say do as much note taking as you can even if it is a little word that jogs your memory to remember some detail about the story. Even if it takes more time to create the folder and the note, it will help you at least to remember doing it and testing it if nothing else.</p>

<p>Although I don&#8217;t think I will do one for everything I will certainly try. Now with these awesome tools at my disposal I might even enjoy the rigidity of the keyboard more. 😉</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Have a wonderful evening!</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>
