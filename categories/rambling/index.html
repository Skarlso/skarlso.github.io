            	I used to have great ideas on the toilet, but I no longer do. And I would like to reflect on that. So this is not going to be a technical post, rather some ramblings. I already had a post similar to this one, but I failed to follow up on it, and now I&#8217;m re-visiting the question. With technology on the rise, embedded systems, chips, augmented biology and information being available at our fingertips, I have but one concern.

            	If you are installing something with Packer and you have Headless enabled(and you are lazy and don&#8217;t want to switch it off), it gets difficult, to see output. Especially on a windows install the Answer File / Unattended install can be like =&gt; Waiting for SSH&#8230; for about an hour or two! If you are doing this locally fret not. Just start VirtualBox, and watch the Preview section which will display the current state even if it&#8217;s a headless install!

            	Fact is, I&#8217;ve been busy. I&#8217;ve got a new job as a build engineer. As sort of a devops kind of guy. It&#8217;s extremely interesting considering that I made a career as a tester. Granted, I always was technical, and never really knew my path; but it seems my path is finding me after all. In the past years, I got better at Docker, Puppet, Chef, AWS, Packer, Vagrant, Gradle, and a hell of a lot more.

<p>Not really. So let&#8217;s talk about this topic for a little bit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you already read a gazillion posts about this debate but frankly I&#8217;m writing this for myself, to rant a little bit, you know&#8230; Because somebody is wrong on the internet and I must intervene.</p>

            	Hello. So let&#8217;s clarify this&#8230; They rarely or ever work if you are a beginner blogger. If you have a reputation it will probably work or people will use it as a reference. But I&#8217;m skipping ahead. Beginnings When you are a beginner blog writer you want to get out as much content as possible. Write mostly relevant things and interesting information because you need to establish a name for yourself.

            	Hello everybody. I&#8217;d like to explain a lot about a topic that is very near my heart. If your job is in an office you will understand this. Why offices? So why are we sitting together in one big place cramped up with 20-300 other people? Why bother the catering and the ventilation and what not to accommodate these people at one place? Why not just leave them be and let them work at home?

            	Hello folks! Today I would like to write about something very interesting I&#8217;m seeing all over the place from recruiters. And that is tool requirements from developers. For words So why is it a problem that in a requirement from a developer there a lots of these: &#8211; DB2 &#8211; QTP &#8211; Ranorex &#8211; Eclipse ( yes I saw a few of these&#8230; ) &#8211; Hibernate &#8211; Grails &#8211; Ruby on Rails &#8211; &#8230; Long answer The answer is simple yet it has it&#8217;s roots very deep in the recruitment and the way companies work.

From the view point of the program. I&#8217;m planning to put these out in few days successions. I hope you enjoy it. Cheers, Gergely. &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- If I remember correctly it was the year 2012 when I was born. I&#8217;m unsure of this date as my subroutines and algorithms have been re-written so many times that if it weren&#8217;t for my backups I wouldn&#8217;t remember a thing.

Not just in Software business but also in History in Human nature in Physics and Systems. So let&#8217;s see what I&#8217;m talking about. What is Chaos? Chaos is a state of utter confusion. Chaos is the opposite of order.

            	Hi folks. I want to write a little bit about writing a professional blog. Early steps Let&#8217;s first talk about what you understand about professional blog. It&#8217;s either a semi professional one, that mixes life with professionalism, like chess, programming, testing, painting, drawing, engineering whatever your profession is. Or it can be a purely professional one without your life getting involved in it. Either way you have to decide at the beginning.

            	Hello Dear Visitor. Welcome to the ramblings of a software test engineer who thinks that he is a tester but feels like a developer but works as a tester but wants to learn programming like a developer&#8230; And so on and so fort. I will make a journey that has been done by many automation testers. The journey when you decide to step one forward. A friend of mine told me that it is good that a tester learns proper programming and that more should do so.
