            Hello folks.
Today I would like to talk to you about something interesting I was talking about with a developer friend.
We talked about the quality of test code.
He said&#8230; And I will quote this&#8230;&#8221;Why should we care? It&#8217;s not production code. We aren&#8217;t giving it to the customer.&#8221;
There are a few reasons why you are going to get a slap in the face for a sentence like this.

Dear everbody.
I&#8217;d like to present you a small idea I was working on recently. The reminiscence of an old program. From the view point of the program.
I&#8217;m planning to put these out in few days successions.
I hope you enjoy it.
Cheers,
Gergely.

If I remember correctly it was the year 2012 when I was born. I&#8217;m unsure of this date as my subroutines and algorithms have been re-written so many times that if it weren&#8217;t for my backups I wouldn&#8217;t remember a thing.

            Hello everybody.
Today I would like to write about something I experienced over the years of being in the software industry.
Some History
I&#8217;ve been a tester for a long time now. I&#8217;ve been up and down and down and up. I struggled for a very long time until I became somebody who I am today. And I still have many things to learn ahead of me.
I learned from many people.

            Dear Readers.
Today I want to talk to you about something I discovered over years of working and experience.
Also something that I can see in the world repeating over and over again. Not just in Software business but also in History in Human nature in Physics and Systems.
So let&#8217;s see what I&#8217;m talking about.
What is Chaos?
Chaos is a state of utter confusion. Chaos is the opposite of order.

            Hi folks.
I want to write a little bit about writing a professional blog.
Early steps
Let&#8217;s first talk about what you understand about professional blog. It&#8217;s either a semi professional one, that mixes life with professionalism, like chess, programming, testing, painting, drawing, engineering whatever your profession is. Or it can be a purely professional one without your life getting involved in it.
Either way you have to decide at the beginning.

            Hello Dear Visitor.
Welcome to the ramblings of a software test engineer who thinks that he is a tester but feels like a developer but works as a tester but wants to learn programming like a developer&#8230; And so on and so fort.
I will make a journey that has been done by many automation testers. The journey when you decide to step one forward. A friend of mine told me that it is good that a tester learns proper programming and that more should do so.
