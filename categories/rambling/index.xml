      <description>&lt;p&gt;I used to have great ideas on the toilet, but I no longer do. And I would like to reflect on that. So this is not going to be a technical post, rather some ramblings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I already had a post similar to this one, but I failed to follow up on it, and now I&amp;rsquo;m re-visiting the question. With technology on the rise, embedded systems, chips, augmented biology and information being available at our fingertips, I have but one concern. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to sound like an old guy reflecting on history, that now everything is changing and that we need to have a sight on the past and bla bla bla. I do have one valid concern though. We are in danger of loosing ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Quick Tip for Debugging Headless Locally</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2015/07/22/quick-tip-for-debugging-headless-locally/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are installing something with Packer and you have Headless enabled(and you are lazy and don&amp;rsquo;t want to switch it off), it gets difficult, to see output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially on a windows install the Answer File / Unattended install can be like =&amp;gt; Waiting for SSH. for about an hour or two! If you are doing this locally fret not. Just start VirtualBox, and watch the Preview section which will display the current state even if it&amp;rsquo;s a headless install!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Busy building the future</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2015/05/19/busy-building-the-future/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fact is, I&amp;rsquo;ve been busy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve got a new job as a build engineer. As sort of a devops kind of guy. It&amp;rsquo;s extremely interesting considering that I made a career as a tester. Granted, I always was technical, and never really knew my path; but it seems my path is finding me after all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past years, I got better at Docker, Puppet, Chef, AWS, Packer, Vagrant, Gradle, and a hell of a lot more. Also honed my linux skills from the ability of doing an ls -l to do an find . -type f -atime +5 | xargs rm -fr (find all the files which are 5 days older and pipe them to a delete command). I already read many books about devops but this time, it&amp;rsquo;s different. This time, I can actually do these things as well in a live environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>TDD is Dead – Not really</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is TDD dead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really. So let&amp;rsquo;s talk about this topic for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you already read a gazillion posts about this debate but frankly I&amp;rsquo;m writing this for myself, to rant a little bit, you know. Because somebody is wrong on the internet and I must intervene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Note taking what when how often</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2014/05/20/note-taking-what-when-how-often/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to tell you about a little conversation I had with my friend Adrian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic was about how, when and what to log during a testing session regarding a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s see what came out of that talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logging your work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is really not whether you should log your work or not, but rather to what extend. Because we all know that you should log your work. It helps you recall and helps you organize and think out testing strategies. But the extend and methods are a big question. So here is my routine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I started Running</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2014/05/16/how-i-started-running/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to write about something non-technical. I would like to write about running and how I started it and what my experiences were with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tl;dr. here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What led me to running&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were actually two things that led me to start running. Three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason One: The accident&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a bike person by default. I *hate running with a passion. One day I was riding my bike in the woods when suddenly I hit a big ol&amp;rsquo; tree trunk right head on at which moment my bikes front fork bent inwards and became completely useless. At this point I had to walk home. Repairing it proved to be a bit time consuming so I had to think of some other way to have my regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to write a blog – Why long posts rarely work</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2014/02/13/how-to-write-a-blog-why-long-posts-rarely-work/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://skarlso.github.io/2014/02/13/how-to-write-a-blog-why-long-posts-rarely-work/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s clarify this. They rarely or ever work if you are a beginner blogger. If you have a reputation it will probably work or people will use it as a reference. But I&amp;rsquo;m skipping ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beginnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you are a beginner blog writer you want to get out as much content as possible. Write mostly relevant things and interesting information because you need to establish a name for yourself. To get that starting you want to be as interesting as possible and make people leave with the intent to come back for more.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why does it matter if I sit in an office or in a park</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2014/02/09/why-does-it-matter-if-i-sit-in-an-office-or-in-a-park/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to explain a lot about a topic that is very near my heart. If your job is in an office you will understand this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why offices?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why are we sitting together in one big place cramped up with 20-300 other people? Why bother the catering and the ventilation and what not to accommodate these people at one place? Why not just leave them be and let them work at home?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I recruit – Why tool requirements are stupid</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2014/02/04/how-i-recruit-why-tool-requirements-are-stupid/</link>

      <guid>https://skarlso.github.io/2014/02/04/how-i-recruit-why-tool-requirements-are-stupid/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello folks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to write about something very interesting I&amp;rsquo;m seeing all over the place from recruiters. And that is tool requirements from developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is it a problem that in a requirement from a developer there a lots of these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DB2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;QTP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ranorex&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eclipse ( yes I saw a few of these. )&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hibernate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Grails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Long answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple yet it has it&amp;rsquo;s roots very deep in the recruitment and the way companies work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why you should care about the quality of your test code</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2013/11/02/why-you-should-care-about-the-quality-of-your-test-code/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to talk to you about something interesting I was talking about with a developer friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about the quality of test code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said. And I will quote this.&amp;ldquo;Why should we care? It&amp;rsquo;s not production code. We aren&amp;rsquo;t giving it to the customer.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons why you are going to get a slap in the face for a sentence like this. And let&amp;rsquo;s clarify here that we are talking about unit and functional tests as well. It shouldn&amp;rsquo;t matter what tests you are thinking about.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Diary of a Bit</title>

      <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear everbody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to present you a small idea I was working on recently. The reminiscence of an old program. From the view point of the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m planning to put these out in few days successions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheers,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gergely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I remember correctly it was the year 2012 when I was born. I&amp;rsquo;m unsure of this date as my subroutines and algorithms have been re-written so many times that if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for my backups I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t remember a thing. I was a bold adventure of some young minds who thought that with me they will change the face of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>It’s all about human interaction.</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2013/01/31/its-all-about-human-interaction/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to write about something I experienced over the years of being in the software industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some History&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a tester for a long time now. I&amp;rsquo;ve been up and down and down and up. I struggled for a very long time until I became somebody who I am today. And I still have many things to learn ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned from many people. I personally thing my greatest influence on testing was James Marcus Bach and his Brother Jon Bach you should definitely check out these guys. It took me a long time to get to where I am today. And after ~10 years now I can state with a reasonable confidence that this industry is no longer about technology or solutions to technological problems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Chaos There Shall Be Order</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I want to talk to you about something I discovered over years of working and experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also something that I can see in the world repeating over and over again. Not just in Software business but also in History in Human nature in Physics and Systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;rsquo;s see what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Chaos?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaos is a state of utter confusion. Chaos is the opposite of order. Chaos is when everybody does what they want without thinking about the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to write a professional blog</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2012/06/13/how-to-write-a-professional-blog/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 13 Jun 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://skarlso.github.io/2012/06/13/how-to-write-a-professional-blog/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to write a little bit about writing a professional blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s first talk about what you understand about professional blog. It&amp;rsquo;s either a semi professional one, that mixes life with professionalism, like chess, programming, testing, painting, drawing, engineering whatever your profession is. Or it can be a purely professional one without your life getting involved in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way you have to decide at the beginning. Why? Because that&amp;rsquo;s the kind of people you will attract. If you want to attract people from your profession then you have to decide that you will write plenty of your profession into your blog. If you want to attract hobbists more then you write about your profession AND daily life or other situations that are essentially irrelevant. Of course you can get both in both versions but the numbers will be different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Hello and welcome</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2012/02/26/hello-and-welcome/</link>

      <guid>https://skarlso.github.io/2012/02/26/hello-and-welcome/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Dear Visitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the ramblings of a software test engineer who thinks that he is a tester but feels like a developer but works as a tester but wants to learn programming like a developer. And so on and so fort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will make a journey that has been done by many automation testers. The journey when you decide to step one forward. A friend of mine told me that it is good that a tester learns proper programming and that more should do so. She is right. And I will try to document this journey as best as possible. I will try to write down my experiences with java, android, automation, swing, maven, hudson, selenium, cucumber, TDD, BDD, Agile environment and whatever tool I meet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
