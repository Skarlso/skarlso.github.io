      <description>I used to have great ideas on the toilet, but I no longer do. And I would like to reflect on that. So this is not going to be a technical post, rather some ramblings.
I already had a post similar to this one, but I failed to follow up on it, and now I’m re-visiting the question. With technology on the rise, embedded systems, chips, augmented biology and information being available at our fingertips, I have but one concern.</description>

      <title>Quick Tip for Debugging Headless Locally</title>

      <description>If you are installing something with Packer and you have Headless enabled(and you are lazy and don’t want to switch it off), it gets difficult, to see output.
Especially on a windows install the Answer File / Unattended install can be like =&amp;gt; Waiting for SSH… for about an hour or two! If you are doing this locally fret not. Just start VirtualBox, and watch the Preview section which will display the current state even if it’s a headless install!</description>

      <title>Busy building the future</title>

      <description>Fact is, I’ve been busy.
I’ve got a new job as a build engineer. As sort of a devops kind of guy. It’s extremely interesting considering that I made a career as a tester. Granted, I always was technical, and never really knew my path; but it seems my path is finding me after all.
In the past years, I got better at Docker, Puppet, Chef, AWS, Packer, Vagrant, Gradle, and a hell of a lot more.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is TDD dead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not really. So let’s talk about this topic for a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you already read a gazillion posts about this debate but frankly I’m writing this for myself, to rant a little bit, you know… Because somebody is wrong on the internet and I must intervene.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;So let’s see what came out of that talk…&lt;/p&gt;</description>
