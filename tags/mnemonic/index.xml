      <description>Hello.
Today I would like to write about something very interesting to you folks.
It&amp;#8217;s a common remember / recall technique called the Method of loci. Otherwise known as the Memory Palace. A very popular usage can be seen in the episodes of Sherlock Holmes from BBC. He uses it often.
What is the Method of loci?
As the Wikipedia page write so properly&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;In basic terms, it is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information.</description>
