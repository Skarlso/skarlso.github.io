      <description>Dear everbody.
I&amp;rsquo;d like to present you a small idea I was working on recently. The reminiscence of an old program. From the view point of the program.
I&amp;rsquo;m planning to put these out in few days successions.
I hope you enjoy it.
Cheers,
Gergely.
If I remember correctly it was the year 2012 when I was born. I&amp;rsquo;m unsure of this date as my subroutines and algorithms have been re-written so many times that if it weren&amp;rsquo;t for my backups I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t remember a thing.</description>
