      <description>Hi guys.
Today I want to talk about a little adventure I had yesterday night. It was quite the fun and frustration too. But neither comes without the other when it’s about linux.
So let us see what the problem is at hand. The problem machine is a Dell Inspiron N5110 with Nvidia card number one: GeForce GT 525M. And number two: Integrated. Optimus for the win.
So how windows is handling this is actually with a software called Optimus.</description>
