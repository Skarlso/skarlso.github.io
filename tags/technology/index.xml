      <description>Hi folks.
I&amp;#8217;d like to share today something with all of you. I&amp;#8217;ve been thinking about how technology affected my life in the long run. And how I perceive the world today around me. So let&amp;#8217;s go around this topic for a little bit shall we?
The Past
So as somebody who lived for a while without technology coming near family for a decade or so I have a little bit of past in me without smart phones, gadgets, tv or computers for that matter.</description>
