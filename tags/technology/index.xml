      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to share today something with all of you. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how technology affected my life in the long run. And how I perceive the world today around me. So let&amp;rsquo;s go around this topic for a little bit shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Past&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So as somebody who lived for a while without technology coming near family for a decade or so I have a little bit of past in me without smart phones, gadgets, tv or computers for that matter. Much times needed to pass as my family slowly got the money to gather to buy us our new part of the family the ZX Spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
