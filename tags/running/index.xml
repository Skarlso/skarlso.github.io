      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to write about something non-technical. I would like to write about running and how I started it and what my experiences were with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So tl;dr. here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What led me to running&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were actually two things that led me to start running. Three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason One: The accident&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a bike person by default. I *hate running with a passion. One day I was riding my bike in the woods when suddenly I hit a big ol&amp;rsquo; tree trunk right head on at which moment my bikes front fork bent inwards and became completely useless. At this point I had to walk home. Repairing it proved to be a bit time consuming so I had to think of some other way to have my regular exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
