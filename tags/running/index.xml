      <description>Hello Everybody.
Today I would like to write about something non-technical. I would like to write about running and how I started it and what my experiences were with it.
So tl;dr. here we go.
What led me to running
There were actually two things that led me to start running. Three.
Reason One: The accident
I&amp;rsquo;m a bike person by default. I *hate running with a passion. One day I was riding my bike in the woods when suddenly I hit a big ol&amp;rsquo; tree trunk right head on at which moment my bikes front fork bent inwards and became completely useless.</description>
