      <description>Hello everybody.
Today I&amp;#8217;d like to write about something I discovered over the years of researching and following certain people and movements in Testing and Programming world.
Let me tell you that there are quite an amazing amount of stuff to be read out there. It&amp;#8217;s overwhelming.
Let&amp;#8217;s talk about Methodologies first.
There are many out there currently. In programming and in testing too. Many speak of ways how you should or should not do you work.</description>
