      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi Folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever used &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Job DSL plugin&lt;/a&gt; for Jenkins? What is that you say? Well, it&amp;rsquo;s TEH most awesome plug-in for Jenkins to have, because you can CODE your job configuration and put it under source control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, however, I&amp;rsquo;m not going to write about that because the tutorials on Jenkins JOB DSL are very extensive and very well done. Anyone can pick them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to write about a part of it which is even more interesting. And that is, extracting re-occurring parts in your job configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to talk about something I came in contact with, and was hard to find a proper answer / solution for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;rsquo;m writing this down to document my findings. Like the title says, this is about aggregating test result with Jenkins, using the plug-in provided. If you, like me, have a pipeline structure which do not work on the same artifact, but do have a upstream-downstream relationship, you will have a hard time configuring and making Aggregation work. So here is how, I fixed the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Selenium Testing with Packer and Vagrant</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, recently, the tester team talked to me, that their build takes too long, and why is that? A quick look at their configuration and build scripts showed me, that they are actually using a vagrant box, which never gets destroyed or re-started at least. To remedy this problem, I came up with the following solution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Updating All Jenkins Jobs Via Jenkins API â€“ Python</title>
      <link>https://skarlso.github.io/2014/11/07/updating-all-jenkins-jobs-via-jenkins-api-python/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would like to share with you a small script I wrote to update all, or a single, Jenkins job from a Python script remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will enable you to update a Jenkins job from anywhere using an admin credential based on a config.xml template that you have. With this, if you want to apply a config change to all or just a single job in Jenkins, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to go and do it for all the rest. You just call this script and it will cycle through all the jobs you have and update them if the begin with &amp;ldquo;yourpipelinedelimiter&amp;rdquo; or if they aren&amp;rsquo;t in a restricted list of jobs. The delimiter helps to identify pipelines which are dev pipelines. If you have multiple pipelines which are helpers or builders and you don&amp;rsquo;t usually apply the same config to them, than the delimiter can help identify the dev pipelines you actually want to update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
