      <description>Hi everybody.
Today I want to talk to you about.. Well.. How to read a professional book for slow learners without too much waste of time.
Let us start at the&amp;#8230; well&amp;#8230; the beginning. How do you normally read a book if you want to memorize it properly. You read it once and then re read the whole thing again until it gets in your head? Or do you have another strategy?</description>
