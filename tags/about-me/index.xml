      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you some of the experiences I had as a beginner tester. I hope it sets you off on a path to enlightenment and leaves you off with a good appetite for testing. Shall we begin then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The early days&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was 2004 when I finished school and started working at my first company. I finished as a software developer which is kind of an exaggeration since I only finished a 2 years course of it. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really one for school. I was more of a home learner. That&amp;rsquo;s how you learn programming these days anyways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
