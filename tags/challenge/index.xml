      <description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello folks.</p>
<p>Today, I present to you the One Hundred Day Github Challenge.</p>
<p>The rules are simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Minimum of <strong>One</strong> commit every day for a <strong>Hundred days</strong>.</li>
<li>Commit has to be <strong>meaningful</strong> but can be as little as a fix in a Readme.md.</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are on vacation, there are no exceptions.</li>
<li><strong>There. Are. No. Exceptions.</strong></li>
<li>If you <strong>fail</strong> a day, you have to <strong>start over</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>No cheating.</strong> You only cheat yourself, so this is really up to you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me be more clear here, because it seems I wasn&rsquo;t clear enough. What you make out of this challenge, it&rsquo;s up to you. If you just update a readme.md for hundred days, that&rsquo;s fine. Just do it every day. It&rsquo;s a commitment. At least you&rsquo;ll have a nice Readme.</p>
<p>Also, let me be clear on another thing. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS. Even on holidays. No. Exceptions.</p>
<p>So there you have it. It&rsquo;s easy, but then again, it&rsquo;s not.</p>
<p>Mine starts today! 100.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
<p>And happy coding.</p>
<p>Gergely.</p>
