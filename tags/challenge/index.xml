      <description>Hello folks.
Today, I present to you the One Hundred Day Github Challenge.
The rules are simple:
 Minimum of One commit every day for a Hundred days. Commit has to be meaningful but can be as little as a fix in a Readme.md. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if you are on vacation, there are no exceptions. There. Are. No. Exceptions. If you fail a day, you have to start over. No cheating.</description>
