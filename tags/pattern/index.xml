      <description>Hello folks.
Today I want to write about a little trick I learned.
If you are working with legacy code and you don&amp;rsquo;t have the chance to eliminate core design problems, you can use this little pattern to help you out.
Problem
Problem is that you have a class that has a gazillion collaborators and at some point in time one of the clever devs thought it would be a cool idea to do dependancy injection via the constructor.</description>

      <description>Hello chumps.
Today I want to write about jms connection testing with a small framework. I wrote a small thing using a factory object model. It&amp;rsquo;s a lead, a proof of concept. You can use this to go onward.
First, let&amp;rsquo;s begin with the JMS connection it self.
JMS Connection
First rule of thumb is: &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t wait for a response when dealing with JMS queues.&amp;rdquo; How so? Because, a JMS queue is asynchronous so you wont get back anything.</description>
