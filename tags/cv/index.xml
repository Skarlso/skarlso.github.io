      <description>Hello folks!
Today I would like to write about something very interesting I&amp;rsquo;m seeing all over the place from recruiters. And that is tool requirements from developers.
For words
So why is it a problem that in a requirement from a developer there a lots of these:
DB2 QTP Ranorex Eclipse ( yes I saw a few of these. ) Hibernate Grails Ruby on Rails . Long answer
The answer is simple yet it has it&amp;rsquo;s roots very deep in the recruitment and the way companies work.</description>
