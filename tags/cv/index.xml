      <description>Hello folks!
Today I would like to write about something very interesting I’m seeing all over the place from recruiters. And that is tool requirements from developers.
For words
So why is it a problem that in a requirement from a developer there a lots of these:
– DB2
– QTP
– Ranorex
– Eclipse ( yes I saw a few of these… )
– Hibernate
– Grails
– Ruby on Rails</description>
