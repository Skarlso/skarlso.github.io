      <description>Hello folks.
A small update to this. I created the model now, which is the database design for this app. It’s very simple, nothing fancy. Also, I’m writing the app with Python 3 from now on.
Here is the model now:
Worth noting a few things here. The __str__ is only with Python 3. In Python 2 it would be unicode. And the OneToOne and the foreign key are automatically using Primary keys defined in the references model.</description>

      <description>Hello Everybody.
I’d like to introduce T.E.A.S. to you. This is something I came up with yesterday which requires a lot of fantasy some good thinking planning and enthusiastic people. So, let’s get started.
What is it about?
Testing Exploration Adventure Session is about… Testing! There. No real surprise, eh? TEAS has it’s roots in RPGs. Role Playing Games. If you ever heard or read about M.A.G.U.S. or the more known Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons you will have a better understanding of the concept behind this phenomena.</description>
