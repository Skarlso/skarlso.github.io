      <description>Hello folks.
A small update to this. I created the model now, which is the database design for this app. It&amp;#8217;s very simple, nothing fancy. Also, I&amp;#8217;m writing the app with Python 3 from now on.
Here is the model now:
  from django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User &amp;nbsp; # Create your models here. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; class Item&amp;#40;models.Model&amp;#41;: name = models.CharField&amp;#40;max_length=100, default=&#34;Item&#34;&amp;#41; damage = models.IntegerField&amp;#40;default=&amp;#41; defense = models.</description>

      <description>Hello Everybody.
I&amp;#8217;d like to introduce T.E.A.S. to you. This is something I came up with yesterday which requires a lot of fantasy some good thinking planning and enthusiastic people. So, let&amp;#8217;s get started.
What is it about?
Testing Exploration Adventure Session is about&amp;#8230; Testing! There. No real surprise, eh? TEAS has it&amp;#8217;s roots in RPGs. Role Playing Games. If you ever heard or read about M.A.G.U.S. or the more known Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons you will have a better understanding of the concept behind this phenomena.</description>
