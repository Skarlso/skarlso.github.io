      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello everybody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;rsquo;d like to write about something I discovered over the years of researching and following certain people and movements in Testing and Programming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me tell you that there are quite an amazing amount of stuff to be read out there. It&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;strong&gt;Methodologies&lt;/strong&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many out there currently. In programming and in testing too. Many speak of ways how you should or should not do you work. Many of them tend to say that others aren&amp;rsquo;t the right way. However just as many tend to say that you can share your knowledge or you can only partially use that particular methodology because they realised that if they say others are crap they close themselves from evolving and they create a way of thinking that will say: Ohhh yeah? You can&amp;rsquo;t tell me what I should do! Who are you to say that that technique is wrong?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
