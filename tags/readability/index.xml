      <description>Hi!
I&amp;#8217;ve seen this many times over and over again. Many people have wrote books about it already. Like Uncle Bob&amp;#8217;s Clean Code. Like Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. What makes your code understandable to others.
Is it Comments?
No. It&amp;#8217;s not comments. If your code could be read properly you wouldn&amp;#8217;t need comments to explain what it does. Like Uncle Bob said. A good code doesn&amp;#8217;t contain surprises.</description>
