      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to write a little bit about writing a professional blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Early steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s first talk about what you understand about professional blog. It&amp;rsquo;s either a semi professional one, that mixes life with professionalism, like chess, programming, testing, painting, drawing, engineering whatever your profession is. Or it can be a purely professional one without your life getting involved in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way you have to decide at the beginning. Why? Because that&amp;rsquo;s the kind of people you will attract. If you want to attract people from your profession then you have to decide that you will write plenty of your profession into your blog. If you want to attract hobbists more then you write about your profession AND daily life or other situations that are essentially irrelevant. Of course you can get both in both versions but the numbers will be different.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
