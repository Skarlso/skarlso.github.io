      <description>Hey folks.
I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day.
If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It’s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know… It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.</description>
