      <description>Hello folks!
Today I would like to write about something very interesting I&amp;#8217;m seeing all over the place from recruiters. And that is tool requirements from developers.
For words
So why is it a problem that in a requirement from a developer there a lots of these:
&amp;#8211; DB2
&amp;#8211; QTP
&amp;#8211; Ranorex
&amp;#8211; Eclipse ( yes I saw a few of these&amp;#8230; )
&amp;#8211; Hibernate
&amp;#8211; Grails
&amp;#8211; Ruby on Rails</description>
