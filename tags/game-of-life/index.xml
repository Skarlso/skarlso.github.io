      <description>So today at 8-12PM I had a great session with two friends of mine. It was awesome. Like a mini code retreat.
We set down in a musky bar, drank wine and beer and cider, and decided to practice some TDD with the well known problem of Conway&amp;#8217;s Game of Life. This challenge is really interesting. I never done it before, ever. So it was a really good practice for me.</description>
