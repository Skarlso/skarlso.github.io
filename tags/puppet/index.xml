      <description>Hello folks.
So, some of you know puppet, some of you don&amp;rsquo;t. Puppet is a configuration management system. It&amp;rsquo;s quite awesome. I like working with it. One of the benefits of puppet is, that I never, ever, EVER have to setup a new laptop from scratch, EVER again.
I&amp;rsquo;m writing a puppet manifest file which sets up my new laptop to my liking. I will improve it as I go along.</description>
