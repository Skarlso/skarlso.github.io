      <description>Dear Readers.
Today I want to talk to you about something I discovered over years of working and experience.
Also something that I can see in the world repeating over and over again. Not just in Software business but also in History in Human nature in Physics and Systems.
So let&amp;rsquo;s see what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.
What is Chaos?
Chaos is a state of utter confusion. Chaos is the opposite of order.</description>
