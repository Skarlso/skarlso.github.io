      <description>Hi folks.
I want to write a little bit about writing a professional blog.
Early steps
Let’s first talk about what you understand about professional blog. It’s either a semi professional one, that mixes life with professionalism, like chess, programming, testing, painting, drawing, engineering whatever your profession is. Or it can be a purely professional one without your life getting involved in it.
Either way you have to decide at the beginning.</description>
