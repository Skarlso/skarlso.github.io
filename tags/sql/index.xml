      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last I was writing about why a tester should learn Javascript. Today I would like to write about why a tester should learn SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, I said it. I know many people, especially testers, don&amp;#8217;t like SQL. They view it as a monster best be avoided. Something only Database people will know. Something which is so scary and ugly, nobody really wants it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I will give you a couple of good reasons why you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be afraid of SQL. And why you should welcome it as your best friend and partner in crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s go.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
