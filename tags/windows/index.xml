      <title>Packer 0.8.1.</title>

      <description>Previously I wrote that the scripts I’m writing, are failing because Packer hangs.
Apparently, this was a known issue. And apparently, I was using an older version, 0.7.5. After I updated everything is working wonderfully!!!
And for my thanks, here is an updated PowerShell script for provisioning my dotnet stuff.
Thanks for reading!

      <title>Powershell can also be nice -Or Installing Java silently and waiting</title>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today, I would like to show you a small script. It installs Java JDK, both version, x86 and 64 bit, silently, and wait for that process to finish.
The wait is necessary because /s on a java install has the nasty habit of running in the background. If you are using a .bat file, you shouldn’t, than you would use something like: start /w jdk-setup.exe /s. This gets it done, but is ugly.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to write about something close to my heart recently. I’ve been fiddling with Packer, Windows and Vagrant these days. Trying to get a Windows box up in running is a pain in the arse though, so I thought I share my pain with you nice folks out there. Let’s begin.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
