      <description>Hi folks.
Just a small script which calculates your distance from a lever focal point if you know your weight, the object&amp;rsquo;s weight and the object&amp;rsquo;s and the distance the object has from the focal point of the lever.
Like this:
This script will give you D1. And this is how it will look like in doing so:
So, in order for me (77kg) to lift an object of 80kg which is on a, by default, 1 meter long lever, I have to stand back ~1.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about plans. It&amp;rsquo;s good to have one. For example, I have a plan for this year.
I kind of like math. So, I have this book:
It&amp;rsquo;s 1400 pages long and basically, has everything in it. It&amp;rsquo;s a rather exhaustive book. Hence, my plan is to finish the book by the end of 2015 and write a couple of python scripts that calculate something interesting.
(2021 Hindsight): Yeah, I didn&amp;rsquo;t manage this&amp;hellip; But it&amp;rsquo;s a cool idea, let&amp;rsquo;s see if I can get around coming further.</description>
