I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.
Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm
You can try something like that:
But that isn’t giving you too much now is it? And the API of scenario is as small as it can get. It offers you four options:

                <p>Hello everybody.</p>
<p>I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.</p>
<p>Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm</p>
<p>You can try something like that:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>But that isn’t giving you too much now is it? And the API of scenario is as small as it can get. It offers you four options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>getStatus</li>
<li>isFailed</li>
<li>write</li>
</ul>
<p>That doesn’t help me. I wanted to get the name of the executed feature and the tags on that particular feature. I thought that’s got to be as easy as just getting a scenario accessing the feature and get the tags. Hooooowww boy I was wrong.</p>
<p>I ended up with this….</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Ohhhhh yes! The fields which I wanted were all private and not accessible. I’m sure there was a reason behind this decision but if it was sensible it eludes me. But in the world of programming nothing is impossible they say so there.</p>
<p>In cucumberFeature there will be everything what you need. Tags, Names, Tests, Execution time. Everything.</p>
<p>I know that cucumber runs with jUnit so if there is a better way to do this please for the love of my sanity share it with me.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
<p>And as always,</p>
<p>Have a nice day.</p>
