I would go even further, and say: Testers, are scientists.\nLet us see how the two compare.\nAsking Questions A scientist is all about asking the right question to the right person, or the right subject matter. They are using the same 5 Ws as we are. Who, Why, What, When, Where. It’s simple, really. Asking the right question is sometimes the most difficult task of them all. Ideas come from these questions. They can also help in flushing out early design problems with the experiment / product.\nIdentify the subject matter This one is all about getting to know your environment and taking notes while you are doing so. Become familiar with what you are working with, and what tools you are using in your research. Which standards are you following, and why? It’s the same, when a Tester finds herself/himself in a new environment and tries to get her(is) bearing what the task is and how to perform it.\nFirst impression, outline of an idea The first impression will result in a vague idea of what the problem is about. This is the stage where the first thoughts emerge and the first draft of a possible solution is crafted into existence. This is the part where a person will draw information, power, and knowledge from her(is) past resulting in a solution that can get close to a real one; but rarely is this solution the one which will be chosen in the end.\nTesting Indeed in the life of a scientist it is imperative that ideas, solutions and vague drafts of brainstormed possibilities are **tested all the way through. **For a tester it’s just as important that all the cases are verified and ‘approved’ by either common sense, the requirements, or any other kind of verification that they can come up in certain environments. Fact is, that if a solution / test case is a valid one, depends on several different options based on any given circumstance. That is why it’s difficult to decide if something is acceptable or not. What is a good solution in one case, might be entirely wrong in another.\nResults If the tests / variables / cases / solutions are satisfying, then we can come to think about producing an actual result. The result could be anything of value to the observer. A failing test could be a good result, if we actually were waiting for that test to fail. In that case the result is a success. So bare in mind that a failing test, a failed solution to an experiment, is **always **also information which **tells you something important. **Never dismiss a failing test, a failed experiment, a failed solution. It gives you a **hint **for a passing one.\nCommunity and Sharing Scientists have a large community where they are sharing experiments and discoveries. I think I don’t have to draw a parallel here. We all know several testing pages, forums, events, gatherings where there are people talking about the subject matter. I’m proud that it such a long way.\nPractice, practice, practice I think this one is self explanatory. In order to become good at something, we have to continuously do it. There is no magic formula, no pill you can take, no matrix to download Kung Fu, you have to do it to learn it. You have to practice it, gather experience and share / write them down in order to strengthen your knowledge and understanding about it. Writing it out, and sharing information, **explaining it to somebody else, **will make it stick better and increase your knowledge in return. So start a blog now, even if you will have only a few readers it will be worth it. Just by writing a couple of lines about something will make you remember it better, and your understanding of it deeper.\nSo, there you have it. I think these are pretty good points that let’s us identify ourselves. It’s called Computer science for a reason.\nAs always,\nThanks for reading,\nGergely.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Hello everybody.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to write about little observation I made along the way of being a tester.</p>
<p>The title says it all. I think Testers, are like scientists. I would go even further, and say: Testers, are scientists.</p>
<p>Let us see how the two compare.</p>
<h3 id="asking-questions">Asking Questions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#asking-questions">#</a></h3>
<p>A scientist is all about asking the right question to the right person, or the right subject matter. They are using the same 5 Ws as we are. Who, Why, What, When, Where. It&rsquo;s simple, really.

<h4 id="first-impression-outline-of-an-idea">First impression, outline of an idea<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#first-impression-outline-of-an-idea">#</a></h4>
<p>The first impression will result in a vague idea of what the problem is about.

<h4 id="testing">Testing<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#testing">#</a></h4>
<p>Indeed in the life of a scientist it is imperative that ideas, solutions and vague drafts of brainstormed possibilities are **tested all the way through. **For a tester it&rsquo;s just as important that all the cases are verified and &lsquo;approved&rsquo; by either common sense, the requirements, or any other kind of verification that they can come up in certain environments.
