			<p>I thought I throw my grudge out of the window against Scala and try something with it.</p>

<p>I also got my hands on a fairly new book, called: &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Scala-Practical-Functional-Programming/dp/1449367933/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422340157&sr=8-1&keywords=learning+scala+a+practical" target="_blank">Learning Scala: Practical Functional Programming for the JVM</a>&#8220;. Turns out to be a rather fun book to read. And Jason Swartz has a nice way of writing. So I wanted to play around with <a href="https://www.playframework.com/" target="_blank">Play 2 Framework</a>. It now comes packaged in <a href="https://typesafe.com/get-started" target="_blank">Activator</a>.</p>

<p>So, I started the long path from almost zero to handle all that. I&#8217;m running the latest Ubuntu ( 14 ) and latest Java ( 8 ). The list: Scala, SBT, IntelliJ, Play ( through activator ).</p>

<p>I was pleased that, considering a network which allowed me a download speed of ~1.5MB/s ( that&#8217;s byte, not bit ), I was up and running in about 4 minutes. That&#8217;s Play running, with a test application created through activator and then imported into an IntelliJ Scala project.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m impressed.</p>

<p>I added SBT through the package manager like this:</p>

<pre><code>echo &quot;deb http://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s really simple.</p>

<p>After that, I did an apt-get on the latest Scala.</p>

<p>I already had IntelliJ.</p>

<p>Activator download took me ~1 minute; then I executed the command to create a test app:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code class="language-bash">&lt;span class="pln">$ activator new my&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">-&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">first&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">-&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">app play&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">-&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">scala&lt;/span></code></pre>

<p>Simple. Activator downloaded everything my system was still missing.</p>

<p>Then run the start command:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code class="language-bash">&lt;span class="pln">$ cd my&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">-&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">first&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">-&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">app
$ activator&lt;/span></code></pre>

<p>And you are ready to rock &amp; roll. Importing it in IntelliJ was a blink of an eye.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really impressed with how easy getting started became with these projects and frameworks. I remember a time where I had to configure everything, get tomcat and the whole JVM or Jetty or whatnot, and try to get up and running took half a day at least. Would my internet be faster, I think this would have been even less.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post more as I go forward.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
