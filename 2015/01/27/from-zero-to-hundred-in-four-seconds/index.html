                <p>I thought I throw my grudge out of the window against Scala and try something with it.</p>
<p>I also got my hands on a fairly new book, called: “<!-- raw HTML omitted -->Learning Scala: Practical Functional Programming for the JVM<!-- raw HTML omitted -->“. Turns out to be a rather fun book to read. And Jason Swartz has a nice way of writing. So I wanted to play around with <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Play 2 Framework<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It now comes packaged in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Activator<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>So, I started the long path from almost zero to handle all that. I’m running the latest Ubuntu ( 14 ) and latest Java ( 8 ). The list: Scala, SBT, IntelliJ, Play ( through activator ).</p>
<p>I was pleased that, considering a network which allowed me a download speed of ~1.5MB/s ( that’s byte, not bit ), I was up and running in about 4 minutes. That’s Play running, with a test application created through activator and then imported into an IntelliJ Scala project.</p>
<p>I’m impressed.</p>
<p>I added SBT through the package manager like this:</p>
<pre><code>echo &quot;deb http://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt
</code></pre>
<p>It’s really simple.</p>
<p>After that, I did an apt-get on the latest Scala.</p>
<p>I already had IntelliJ.</p>
<p>Activator download took me ~1 minute; then I executed the command to create a test app:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Simple. Activator downloaded everything my system was still missing.</p>
<p>Then run the start command:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And you are ready to rock &amp; roll. Importing it in IntelliJ was a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>I’m really impressed with how easy getting started became with these projects and frameworks. I remember a time where I had to configure everything, get tomcat and the whole JVM or Jetty or whatnot, and try to get up and running took half a day at least. Would my internet be faster, I think this would have been even less.</p>
<p>I’ll post more as I go forward.</p>
<p>As always,</p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
