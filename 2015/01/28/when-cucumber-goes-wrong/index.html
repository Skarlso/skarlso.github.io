  <div class="post-content"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s face the horrible truth:</p>
<p><strong>It&rsquo;s rare / never happens that a manager / scrum master / product owner actually reads your cucumber test cases.</strong></p>
<p>Back in the old days, this was one of the selling points of human readable tests and DSLs. It sounds nice and I&rsquo;m sure in a utopia it also works.</p>
<p>BDD is a very nice approach to write tests if used in a correct way. And I can relate that at some point, a manager or the product owner, actually writes up a draft of the tests. But that enthusiasm very rarely stays for the rest of the project.</p>
<p>Especially when you get to the point where your Cucumber test cases start to look something like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Scenario: User list
  Given I post to &#34;/users.json&#34; with:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    {
      &#34;first_name&#34;: &#34;Steve&#34;,
      &#34;last_name&#34;: &#34;Richert&#34;
    }
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
  And I keep the JSON response at &#34;id&#34; as &#34;USER_ID&#34;
  When I get &#34;/users.json&#34;
  Then the JSON response should have 1 user
  And the JSON response at &#34;0&#34; should be:
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    {
      &#34;id&#34;: %{USER_ID},
      &#34;first_name&#34;: &#34;Steve&#34;,
      &#34;last_name&#34;: &#34;Richert&#34;
    }
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
</code></pre><p>If a product owner reads this, his reaction will be like: &ldquo;What the hell is this? What&rsquo;s users.json? Why is it there? Why should I even care? What&rsquo;s a JSON response? Why should it match with the request? And what, if I keep the id at USER_ID? Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get overwhelmed by things like this scenario when you start introducing actors into your tests and payloads to your public API. And suddenly you&rsquo;ll end up with cucumber features which no other will be able to understand but the person who wrote it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little bit skeptic that it ever worked as intended. Sure, for a little while. But the dynamic nature of tests will surface soon enough. You can&rsquo;t hide it forever.</p>
<p>The above example, if the payload and user would be hidden in a reusable code fragment behind the implementation, would look a bit more readable:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Scenario: User list
  Given I post to user list with data
  | firstname | Steve |
  | lastname  | Richert |
  When I get a response from the SUT
  Then the response should have the same user

<p>I&rsquo;m sure Cucumber has a couple of success stories behind his back, I just didn&rsquo;t happen to come across them as of late. But please, if you have one, share it with me so I can rest easily.</p>
