                <p>Hi folks.</p>
<p>So last time, we tried to implement a little RPG of mine using Meteor, which failed miserably. This time we are going to try and use Django. Let’s have at it, shall we?</p>
<p>If you don’t know what django is (than you are probably not reading this blog entry anyways… ), have a look =&gt; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Link<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. It’s a Python Web Framework.</p>
<h1 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning</h1>
<p>So here we are again. I’m starting off by creating the skeleton for my RPG. First, the welcome page with a tiny login capability. Which means session tracking. For now, on the same page.</p>
<p>To create the skeleton I just run this little command:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Easy enough, right? Basic directory structure is created. You can read that in django’s own documentation: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/intro/tutorial01/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I’m using Sublime Text 3 to build this app. I was thinking of pycharm, but that would take away too much fun.</p>
<p>By default Django uses SQLlite and I’m okay with that.</p>
<p>The basics are there. Let’s move to higher ground. The next step can be to design the login page. I’m not much of a designer so I’ll leave that part to people who care more / understand it better. I’m only looking for a simple Login with a username and a password. Nothing fancy. And I’m going to use Django’s auth system for users: <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->django.contrib.auth<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It’s pretty good, has lots of features and can auth a user pretty quickly given a username and password, which is all I want for now.</p>
<p>I running a migrate command to create all the necessary tables and data:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A quick check with sqlite3 and running **.schema **showed me that the tables are indeed created and filled with default data for all the **INSTALLED_APPS **django has at the moment.</p>
<p>I did a quick check with <em>python manage.py runserver</em> and everything seems to work fine.</p>
<h1 id="the-rpg-app">The RPG App</h1>
<h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>So, that concludes the setup. Following the tutorial, django has this notion of apps and projects. In short, a project is a set of configurations and applications which forms a website. Hence, I’m going to create an RPG APP for now. The tutorial continues with a Poll type of App, but I’m sure I can apply the same things to a login page.</p>
<p>First, let’s create the App using the command:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That creates the skeleton for the app. The tutorial then suggests to define the database first. Which I think is a bad idea; usually when doing design, you don’t want to start with the database model. But for now, I shall comply. We want a login page and we are using the auth module, which means, for now, I don’t care about the database. Skip.</p>
<p>I’m going to go off corse for now, since I only want to create a basic login. For that, I have to read up on views and models a little bit in order to create a simple login page. Be right back…</p>
<p>I’m fighting the basic auth system at the moment. Everything seems to be working fine. In the Admin screen I was able to add a basic user to do some debugging, but for now, the login seems to not work with this error:</p>
<p><strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->CSRF verification failed. Request aborted.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></strong></p>
<p>This is the CSRF protection which came out with Django. I did a bit of more document reading and setup the CSRF as was described here:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/csrf/">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/csrf/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>However, I’m still facing the same problem. Let’s research further… Ahh yes. I wasn’t returning the request context I’ve set up. Before:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Notice that now I’m returning the request context at the end when I’m rendering the response. And lo’ and behold, my login is now working.</p>
<h1 id="progress-so-far">Progress so far</h1>
<p> </p>
<p>So, I’ve set up a user using the Admin portal accessible from the app / admin. Created my default rpg app, and added my default auth view into a template folder. Configured the URL setting in <strong>urls.py</strong> to look like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Very basic for now, but when I return to it, we are going to clean it up and then continue with implementing the main screen which will greet the user and display some stats about his/her character.</p>
<p>The whole code is under github here =&gt; <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/myrpg">https://github.com/Skarlso/myrpg</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Bye for now,</p>
<p>And thanks for reading.</p>
