<p>Continuing where we left off with the Django RPG project. Next up is implementing a rudimentary registration and adding the ability to create a character. Maybe even, design the database through django’s modelling.</p>
<p>Since we are using Django’s very own authentication model, I think we are covered in terms of users. Let’s add two things for now. An Index page, where there is a link to login and a link to registration.</p>
<p>Adding the index first. Later I would like to switch to a base template model, but for now, I created a simple index.html page. That only contains the two links to the two views. The views are a simple function call in the views.py too which the URLConfig will later point to.</p>
<p>For now, the index function looks like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Note, that the title here is utterly unimportant but because I want to switch to a base.html template I’ll leave it here for later usage.</p>
<p>That concludes the index. Now, let’s create the registration. That is a little more complex, but still rather easy. We are just checking of the user already exists or not, if so, display and error, if not, create the user.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Here, I’m checking to see of the username already exists with the filter. This is by using Django’s model which models the database like hibernate. It’s a simple query. And I’m doing this, because this is faster than raising an exception. Later on, I’ll be switching to a validation framework and django’s own auth view. Because, why not.</p>
<p>The URL conf looks like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>And this now, resides in a file under the RPG app and not the main one. The main one includes this one, like this:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>That’s it for now. As always, you can check out the code under github.</p>
<p>Tune in next time, when I’ll attempt to create a view to create a Character for a logged in user and link it to the user. I’ll do this with django’s model framework.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>
<p>Gergely.</p>
