Today I would like to write about an AWS finger practice.

My build and deploy cycle is simple.

<p>Hi All.</p>
<p>Today I would like to write about an AWS finger practice.</p>
<p>Previously, I wrote about how I build and deploy my blog with <a href="www.wercker.com">Wercker</a>. Since, I&rsquo;m a cloud engineer and I dislike Oracle and it&rsquo;s ever expending tenctacles into the abyss, I wanted to switch to use something else.</p>
<p>My build and deploy cycle is simple.</p>
<p>Commit to Blogsource Repo -&gt; Wercker WebHook -&gt; Builds my blog using Hugo -&gt; Pushed to a Different Repository which my Github Blog.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s all.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s quiet possible to reproduce this on AWS without infering costs. Unless you publish like&hellip; a couple 100 posts / week.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to use the following services: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/details/">AWS Lambda</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/">CodeBuild</a>, <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a>.</p>
<p>To deploy the below describe architecture in your account in us-east-1 region simply click this button:
<a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=blogbuilder&amp;templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/blog-builder-template-bucket/template.yaml"><img src="/img/cloudformation-launch-stack.png" alt="Launch Stack"></a></p>
<p>BEFORE doing that though you need the following created:</p>
<p>Have a bucket for your lambda function. The lambda function can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/aws-lambda-code-pusher">Lambda Repository</a>.</p>
<p>Zip up the lambda folder contents by doing this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">cd lambda
zip -r gitpusher.zip *
aws s3 cp gitpusher.zip s3://your-lambda-bucket
</code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>To read a description of the stack, please continue.</p>
<h1 id="tldr">TL;DR;</h1>
<p>The architecture I&rsquo;m about to lay out is simple in its use and design. I tried not to complicate things, because I think the simpler something is, the less prone to failure it will be.</p>
<p>In its most basic form the flow is as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog_builder_flow.png" alt="Flow">.</p>
<p>You push something into a repository you provide. CodeBuild has a webhook to this repository so on each commit it starts to build the blog. The build will use a so called <code>buildspec.yaml</code> file which describes how your blog should be built. Mine looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="color:#f92672">version</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">0.2</span>

<span style="color:#f92672">phases</span>:
  <span style="color:#f92672">install</span>:
    <span style="color:#f92672">commands</span>:
      - <span style="color:#ae81ff">echo Installing required packages and Hugo</span>
      - <span style="color:#ae81ff">apt-get update</span>
      - <span style="color:#ae81ff">apt-get install -y git golang wget</span>
      - <span style="color:#ae81ff">wget -q https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.31/hugo_0.31_Linux-64bit.deb -O /tmp/hugo.dep</span>
      - <span style="color:#ae81ff">dpkg -i /tmp/hugo.dep</span>
  <span style="color:#f92672">pre_build</span>:
    <span style="color:#f92672">commands</span>:
      - <span style="color:#ae81ff">echo Downloading source code</span>
      - <span style="color:#ae81ff">git clone https://github.com/Skarlso/blogsource.git /opt/app</span>
  <span style="color:#f92672">build</span>:
    <span style="color:#f92672">commands</span>:
      - <span style="color:#ae81ff">echo Build started on `date`</span>
      - <span style="color:#ae81ff">cd /opt/app &amp;&amp; hugo --theme purehugo</span>
  <span style="color:#f92672">post_build</span>:
    <span style="color:#f92672">commands</span>:
      - <span style="color:#ae81ff">echo Build completed on `date`</span>
<span style="color:#f92672">artifacts</span>:
  <span style="color:#f92672">files</span>:
    - <span style="color:#ae81ff">/opt/app/public/**/*</span>
</code></pre></div><p>When it&rsquo;s finished, CodeBuild will upload everything in the public folder as a zip to a bucket. The bucket has a lambda attached which triggers on putObject event with the extension <code>.zip</code>. It downloads the archive, extracts it and pushes it to another repository, which is the repository for the blog.</p>
<p>And done! That&rsquo;s it. For an architecture overview, please read on.</p>
<h1 id="architecture">Architecture</h1>
<p>Now, we are going to use CloudFormation stack to deploy these resources. Because we aren&rsquo;t animals to create them by hand, yes?</p>
<p>An overview of my current architecture is best shown by this image:</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog_builder_cf_template.png" alt="AWS Stack">.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go over these components one - by - one.</p>
<h2 id="lambda-role">Lambda Role</h2>
<p>This is the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html">Role</a> which allows the Lambda to access things in your account. It needs the following service access: s3, logs, lambda; and the following permissions: logs:Create*, logs:PutLogEvents, s3:GetObject, s3:ListBucket.</p>
<h2 id="code-build-role">Code Build Role</h2>
<p>This is the role which allows CodeBuild to have access to services it needs. These services are the following: s3, logs, ssm, codebuild. CodeBuild also needs the following actions allowed: logs:Create*, logs:PutLogEvents, s3:GetObject, s3:PutObject, ssm:GetParameters.</p>
<h2 id="build-bucket">Build Bucket</h2>
<p>This is the bucket in which CodeBuild will push the generated build artifact.</p>
<h2 id="blog-pusher-function">Blog Pusher Function</h2>
<p>This is the heart of this project. It contains the logic to download the zipped artifact, extract it, create a hollow repository from the extracted archive and push the changes to the repository. And just the changes.</p>
<p>This is achieve by a short Python 3.6 script which can be found in the linked repository.</p>
<h2 id="parameters">Parameters</h2>
<p>The stack requires you to provide a couple of parameters which are described in the template. Like, bucket name, github repository, git token and such. Please refer to the template for a full description of each.</p>
<h2 id="charges">Charges</h2>
<p>I recently push a couple of builds to test this configuration and I inferred 0.2 USD in charges. But that was like 10-15 builds a day.</p>
<h1 id="deploying">Deploying</h1>
<p>In order to deploy this you can use <a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/go-furnace">Furnace</a> to easily manage the template and it&rsquo;s parameters. Once you copy the template to the target directory, simply run <code>furnace aws create</code> and provide the necessary parameters.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>And that is all. A nice little stack which does the same as Wercker without costs but the leisure of simply pushing up some change to a repository of your choosing.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed this little write up as much as I enjoyed creating it.</p>
<p>As always,
Thanks for reading!
Gergely.</p>
