# Notetaking with ADHD

After several years, I finally have my official diagnosis. ADHD. I had it as a kid as well, in hindsight, it was pretty
fucking obvious. I could reminisce about those days for a long time. How things now fit together, how everything suddenly
fell into place. Why the things happened to me as they did and how I was always _always_ in the middle of every shit-storm.

But that is all in the past now. All under the rug. I can only do so much about this. Recently, it got a bit more difficult
to manage though. I'm guessing that's because my life as a whole got a bit more difficult too. Lot of new things to take
care of and keep in my head constantly. Lot of things to juggle and pay attention to. Lot of things that happen in the
world too that I need to not care about or care about in _some_ way.

One thing that I always sort of struggled with was notetaking. I have been on and off on many many _many_ **_MANY_**
systems in my life. But one system I always get back to. Plain pen and paper in my notebook.

Recently, I've been combining things digitally now for a little while. It works rather well and now I understand why.

_Shiny things take my attention._ I'm like a crow. Something that is nice and shiny and in front of me will take my
attention and I more likely will interact with said thing.

This means if a nice, lovely, worn, leader bound like straight out of an adventure movie notebook is sitting in front of
me I will want to write into it. However, sometimes, writing by hand is just plain too slow. I want to express myself I
want to write down my thoughts I will write in Obsidian.

And I will also write notes in Obsidian about my work. I use the notebook for journaling mostly, or quick jots, ideas,
etc.

Anything I want searchable I'm going to write down digitally.

This system kept me happy for a while now. I hope it would help others as well.

Thanks for reading!
