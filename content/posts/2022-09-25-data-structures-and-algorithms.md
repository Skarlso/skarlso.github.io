Hello!

I've been working on something extensive these days. Like my [Grokking Algorithms](https://skarlso.github.io/2022/01/26/readers-digest/#grokking-algorithms) summary, I now moved on to read
[Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Sense-Guide-Structures-Algorithms-Second/dp/1680507222/).

As with Grokking, I created a Go based repo and added notes for each chapter.

The repo can be located [here](https://github.com/Skarlso/data-structures-and-algorithms).

Enjoy,
and thanks for reading.
Gergely.
