Hello!

Just wanted to give an update to my crd-to-sample-yaml tool. It, now, supports creating a standalone HTML output.

Why, you may ask? Well, now you can host the generated content as a static page on your website. That's pretty handy.

Here is a sample output:

![crd to yaml](/img/2024/05/09/crd-to-yaml-sample-html-output.png)

Go and get it while it's hot in version [v0.4.0](https://github.com/Skarlso/crd-to-sample-yaml/releases/tag/v0.4.0).

That's all. Thanks for reading!
