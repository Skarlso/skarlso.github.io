Hi Folks.

I started to build a Progress Quest type of web app in Go.

If you'd like to join, or just tag along, please drop by here => <a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/goprogressquest" target="_blank">Go Progress Quest</a> and feel free to submit an issue if you have an idea, or would like to contribute!

I will try and document the Progress.

Thank you for reading!

Gergely.
