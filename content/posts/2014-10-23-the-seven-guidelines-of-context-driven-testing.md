Hi Folks!

I just wanted to share with you my mind map on the seven principles of Context Driven Testing.

I used the notion of dragons since it's seven. And a dragon is usually seven headed in my mind.

So without further ado.

Click for larger image.

I have a hand drawn as well but I'm guessing that one wouldn't be of much use since it follows my own imagination.

Here are the seven principles in points which correspond to the leafs.

  1. Value -> Practice -> Depends -> Context => The value of any practice depends on its context.
  2. People -> Working -> Together -> Important => People, working together, are the most important part of any project’s context. ( The mob, trying to kill the dragon by working together. )
  3. Problem -> Project -> Solution => The product is a solution. If the problem isn’t solved, the product doesn’t work. ( The sword. It's a sword but if it doesn't kill the Dragon it's useless. )
  4. Good Testing -> Intellectual Challenge => Good software testing is a challenging intellectual process. ( Well it's a dragon with glasses. That's something you rarely see. )
  5. Good Practice | Bad Practice -> In Context -> No Best Practices => There are good practices in context, but there are no best practices. ( This one was a little bit tricky. But basically you want to solve the dungeon and not plow through it )
  6. Uncertainty => <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;">Projects unfold over time in ways that are often not predictable. ( For me this one word was enough. )</span>
  7. Exercised By All In Time -> Judgement | Skill | Cooperatively => Only through judgment and skill, exercised cooperatively throughout the entire project, are we able to do the right things at the right times to effectively test our products. ( It's a flexing dragon. Easy, right? )

So this map helped me to remember everything. The descriptions, applications that are further described I remembered by using this mind map as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci" target="_blank">loci</a>.

I hope somebody found this useful.

Thanks for reading!

Gergely.
