# Reader's Digest - January

## Immune

[Immune](https://www.amazon.com/Immune-Journey-Mysterious-System-Keeps/dp/0593241312) is an absolutely fabulous book. It's amazing
and in time of this pandemic a healthy read to boot. I love biology, but never went too deep into it. This book fascinated
me with its colorful images, the style of Kurzgesagt story telling and the man himself, who is the voice of Kurzgesagt.
I've read it all with his voice in my head.

It describes a great journey into the human body and how the immune system works in a high level view. It goes into some
detail about cells and their responsibilities and how they distinguish self from other. How they wage war on intruders
and how they fend off viruses and bacteria alike. It's a captivating story! It has two major events that goes through
the cycle of the immune system. One is a penetration of a toa with a sharp nail in the woods and how that infection
spreads. And the other is when someone coughed in the office and you get infected by influenza.

## Book One of Wheel Of Time series

[Wheel Of Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time) is a fantasy novel I've been putting off reading for a while
now, because it's massive. It has 20 books in it in total. But I did start eventually with an audiobook of [Eye of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_World).
I love Michael Kramer and Kate Reading. They are both absolutely fantastic and I know them already from other books
of Brandon. The book has a good pace and although it starts off with little to no information about the world, you
slowly are filled in as the journey goes.

## Skyward Flight - Cytonic

This is the [third book](https://www.amazon.com/Cytonic-The-Third-Skyward-Novel/dp/B096BLM1Y4) in the Skyward Flight series! We follow Spensa into the Nowhere, where she meets a gentleman
adventurer named Chad. They find pirates, adventure, a quest... All very much something Spensa enjoys too well. She
finally gets a glimpse of her real power and understands them more. Fantastic third book, I enjoyed listening to it.

## Skyward Flight - Eversore - Book 3.1

This caught me off guard. I didn't know this [existed](https://www.amazon.com/Evershore-Skyward-Flight-Novella-3/dp/B09G3KQRNK/), neither did I know that book 2.1 exited which followed Alanik's
story and apparently, a lot of other things happened in that book too which were important to the whole of the series!
I don't understand why those didn't come out as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 instead of smaller books. Since they have events which
are important to the characters and the story as a whole. Ah well. I listened to it now and it was fantastic. This book
follows Jorgen, and how he develops his cytonic abilities. And they make acquaintance with the Kitsen!

## Grokking Algorithms

[Grokking Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-Aditya-Bhargava-audio/dp/B07HQYBNYK) is a small book containing a set of basic algorithms explained in great detail!
I made a Go based repository from them containing a great many explanations using Type Parameters (generics).

The repo is located [here](https://github.com/Skarlso/grokking-algorithms).

Thank you for reading!

Gergely.
