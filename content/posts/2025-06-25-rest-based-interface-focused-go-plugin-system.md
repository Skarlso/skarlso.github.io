# REST based, interface focused Go plugin system using UDS or TCP

Hello everyone.

Today, I would like to show a plugin system I've been working on for Go that's intuitive to use
and implement from the Plugin author's side and intuitive to use from the Library's side.

The communication is REST based with the connection being either UDS ( Unix Domain Socket ) or TCP
based. Depending on availability but defaulting / starting with the socket approach.

Let's get into it.
