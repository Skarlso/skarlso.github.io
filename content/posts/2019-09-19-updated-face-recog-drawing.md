I had a lot of fun using [Procreate](https://procreate.art) to re-draw the architecture image I've drawn for my distribute face recognition application detailed in this post [Distributed Face-Recognition App](https://skarlso.github.io/2018/03/15/kubernetes-distributed-application/).

Without much fanfare, here is the drawing:
