Hi folks.

I wanted to take the time to share with you a talk that I recently did.

The slides and the source I used, can be found here: [Github](https://github.com/Skarlso/jenkinsbestpractices).

And then, there is also a docker image which contains all the plugins, job configurations and all the practices which I did during the talk. Please feel free to have a go with it. [DockerHub - Jenkins Best Practices](https://hub.docker.com/r/skarlso/jenkinsbestpractices).

For easy access and reading, here are the slides on Slideshare: [Jenkins Best Practices Slides](http://www.slideshare.net/GergelyBrautigam/jenkins-best-practices-meetup-slides).

I, gladly answer any questions which should arise.

Thanks!
Gergely.
