# Added Suggest Edit to Post link to all my posts

I added "Suggest edit" to all my posts in a way to open my blob to the community.
I accept all kinds of contriubtions be they simple grammar fixes or more accurate descriptions
of something.

Feel free to suggest changes. I'm also toying with the idea of accepting completely new content
but that remains to be seen.

Thank you, and have a happy new year!

Gergely.
