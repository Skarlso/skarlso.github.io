# CNCF Project Showcases

Hi there, hello. Long time no see. I was very busy these past months.

I thought about a series though that I would like to lead.

Every week or month or so, I'm going to randomly pick a CNCF project for this [CSV - CNCF Projects](https://landscape.cncf.io/docs/projects.csv).

I will explore it and write about it. See what it does, why, how, and for what reason.

I know some folks that already do this, but I don't care. I'm doing it for myself.

Next project, I'm going to disect is... drum rolls... https://www.kanister.io/.

Until then!
Gergely.
