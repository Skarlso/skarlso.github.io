Hi folks.

If you have the tendency, like me, to forget that you are on the corporate VPN, or leave a certain software open when you bring your laptop to work, this might be helpful to you too.

It's a small script which kills a program when you change your Wifi network.

Script:

~~~bash

#!/bin/bash

function log {
    directory="/Users/<username>/wifi_detect"
    log_dir_exists=true
    if [ ! -d $directory ]; then
        echo "Attempting to create => $directory"
        mkdir -p $directory
        if [ ! -d $directory ]; then
            echo "Could not create directory. Continue to log to echo."
            log_dir_exists=false
        fi
    fi
    if $log_dir_exists ; then
        echo "$(date):$1" >> "$directory/log.txt"
    else
        echo "$(date):$1"
    fi
}

function check_program {
    to_kill="[${1::1}]${1:1}"
    log "Checking if $to_kill really quit."
    ps=$(ps aux |grep "$to_kill")
    log "ps => $ps"
    if [ -z "$ps" ]; then
	# 0 - True
        return
    else
	# 1 - False
        return 1
    fi
}

function kill_program {
    log "Killing program"
    `pkill -f "$1"`
    sleep 1
    if ! check_program $1 ; then
	log "$1 Did not quit!"
    else
	log "$1 quit successfully"
    fi
}

wifi_name=$(networksetup -getairportnetwork en0 |awk -F": " '{print $2}')
log "Wifi name: $wifi_name"
if [ "$wifi_name" = "<wifi_name>" ]; then
    log "On corporate network... Killing Program"
    kill_program "<programname>"
elif [ "$wifi_name" = "<home_wifi_name>" ]; then
    # Kill <program> if enabled and if on <home_wifi> and if Tunnelblick is running.
    log "Not on corporate network... Killing <program> if Tunnelblick is active."
    if ! check_program "Tunnelblick" ; then
	log "Tunnelblick is active. Killing <program>"
	kill_program "<program>"
    else
	log "All good... Happy coding."
    fi
else
    log "No known Network..."
fi

Now, the trick is, on OSX to only trigger this when your network changes. For this, you can have a 'launchd' daemon, which is configured to watch three files which relate to a network being changed.

The script sits under your ~/Library/LaunchAgents folder. Create something like, com.username.checknetwork.plist.

~~~xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple Computer//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" \
 "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>ifup.ddns</string>

  <key>LowPriorityIO</key>
  <true/>

  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/Users/username/scripts/ddns-update.sh</string>
  </array>

  <key>WatchPaths</key>
  <array>
    <string>/etc/resolv.conf</string>
    <string>/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/NetworkInterfaces.plist</string>
    <string>/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.airport.preferences.plist</string>
  </array>

  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
~~~

Now, when you change your network, to whatever your corporate network is, you'll kill Sublime.

Hope this helps somebody.

Cheers,

Gergely.
