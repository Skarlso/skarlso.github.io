<p>Hi folks!</p>
<p>Today I would like to write about a metric that I read in a book called Clean Architecture from Robert Cecil Martin ( Uncle Bob ).</p>
<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>The metrics I mean are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_package_metrics">Efferent</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_package_metrics">Afferent</a> coupling in packages. So you, dear reader, don&rsquo;t have to navigate away from this page, here are the descriptions pasted in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Afferent couplings (Ca): The number of classes in other packages that depend upon classes within the package is an indicator of the package&rsquo;s responsibility. Afferent couplings signal inward. (Affected by this package) (Fan-In).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Efferent couplings (Ce): The number of classes in other packages that the classes in this package depend upon is an indicator of the package&rsquo;s dependence on externalities. Efferent couplings signal outward. (Effecting this package) (Fan-Out).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics used together will indicate the stability / instability of each package in a project.</p>
<h1 id="metric-usage">Metric Usage</h1>
<p>What does it mean if the package is stable vs. unstable? Let&rsquo;s take a closer look.</p>
<h2 id="unstable">Unstable</h2>
<p>If the instability metric comes out as 1 or close to 1, that means that the package is unstable. It means that there are only packages which this package is depending upon and nothing, or only 1 or 2, packages depend on it. This infers two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The package is easy to change since there is nothing depending on the behavior explicitly</li>
<li>The package is volatile since it depends on a lot of out side things</li>
</ul>
<p>The first one is self-explanatory. The second one has ramifications. These ramifications are that there are a lot of packages that could cause bugs in this package. Ideally, a package with instability 1 or high, requires a large test coverage to ensure that no bugs seep in.</p>
<h2 id="stable">Stable</h2>
<p>On the other spectrum lies the indicator for a stable package. If this metric is 0 or close to 0, the package is said to be stable. A stable package resists change because it has a lot of depending packages. The depending packages lock this package in place, meaning we can&rsquo;t change the package easily. Ideally this is the package that would contain business logic for example, or code which does not change often.</p>
<h1 id="appliance-in-go-ecosystem">Appliance in Go ecosystem</h1>
<p>The book was using mostly Java or C/C++ for examples and dealt with classes describing these metrics. Especially the Abstractness of a package which calculates as ratio of abstract classes + interfaces vs concrete classes and implementations. This isn&rsquo;t that easy to define in Go. Not impossible though and we could still get something close enough. Something like, count interfaces + structs vs implementations of said interfaces with function receivers and functions.</p>
<p>The easier of these is the coupling metrics. I think we can define them since Go also has import statements. Go doesn&rsquo;t have classes, but it&rsquo;s enough if we calculate the number of packages that said package depends upon and are depended upon by. Should be close enough.</p>
<h1 id="tool">Tool</h1>
<p>If there is a project with a <strong>lot</strong> of packages and files, it would be quite difficult to calculate things using your hands&hellip; Hence, <a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/effrit">Effrit</a>. This tool, at the writing of this post, only calculates the stability metric for now. If given a parameter like <code>-p effrit</code> it will only calculate the Fan-Out metrics considering project packages. If no project name is given, it will also calculate not project packages (for example cobra or aws sdk) as Efferent. Usage is really simple. Navigate to the root of the project and run <code>effrit scan -p &lt;projectname&gt;</code>.</p>
<h1 id="applying-the-tool">Applying the tool</h1>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see with a real example on using the tool and what to do with the metrics it provides.</p>
<p>I have a project called <a href="https://github.com/go-furnace/go-furnace">Furnace</a>. Running the tool on it I get the following stats:</p>
<p><img src="/img/effrit/effrit1.png" alt="furnace-before-tool">.</p>
<p>What do these means?</p>
<p>It means, that hopefully, <code>command</code> packages have a high coverage and that <code>config</code> packages don&rsquo;t require change that often. The coverage count for aws command package is:</p>
<p><code>coverage: 74.7% of statements</code></p>
<p>That is pretty good. I think it&rsquo;s covered well enough for now.</p>
<p>On to the <code>config</code> package. This is the whole file:</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>And that&rsquo;s it. Hopefully this is an interesting metric to use to define what packages may need refactoring, or need to be repurposed because they are too rigid. If a packages is stable, aka. hard to change but must undergo changes frequently, it may be time to refactor and introduce a mediator or a liaison package. If a package is unstable and has a lot of bugs, we might want to refactor it and inverse it&rsquo;s dependencies. This is called the Dependency Inversion Principle, DIP. Which is also described in the same book. However it&rsquo;s not always bad if a package is unstable. Maybe it contains code which needs to change frequently. It&rsquo;s a database schema code. Or an algorithm which requires constant tweaking. And that is fine. Just make sure it&rsquo;s covered well enough.</p>
<p>The principles that these metrics are based on are: <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?StableAbstractionsPrinciple">SAP</a> and <a href="https://www.smartics.eu/confluence/display/ADOC/Stable+Dependencies+Principle">SDP</a>. Stable Abstraction Principle and Stable Dependencies Principle. These are also described in the same book, Clean Architecture. A highly recommend it. Applying these principles could help maintain the project&rsquo;s stability and it&rsquo;s dependencies.</p>
