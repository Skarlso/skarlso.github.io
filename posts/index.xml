      <description>Intro Hi folks.
Previously on this blog: Part 1. Part 2. Part 3.
In this part we are going to talk about Unit Testing Furnace and how to work some magic with AWS and Go.
Mock Stub Fake Dummy Canned  Unit testing in Go usually follows the Dependency Injection model of dealing with Mocks and Stubs.

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
Previously on this blog: Part 1. Part 2.
In this part, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the experimental plugin system of Furnace.
Go Experimental Plugins Since Go 1.8 was released, an exciting and new feature was introduced called a Plug-in system. This system works with dynamic libraries built with a special switch to go build. These libraries, .so or .dylib (later), are than loaded and once that succeeds, specific functions can be called from them (symbol resolution).</description>

Previously on this blog: Part 1.
In this part, I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about the AWS Go SDK and begin do dissect the intricacies of Furnace.
AWS SDK Fortunately, the Go SDK for AWS is quiet verbose and littered with examples of all sorts. But that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make it less complex and less cryptic at times. I&amp;rsquo;m here to lift some of the early confusions, in hopes that I can help someone to avoid wasting time.</description>

      <description>Building Furnace: Part 1 Intro Hi folks.
This is the first part of a 4 part series which talks about the process of building a middlish sized project in Go, with AWS. Including Unit testing and a experimental plugin feature.
The first part will talk about the AWS services used in brief and will contain a basic description for those who are not familiar with them. The second part will talk about the Go SDK and the project structure itself, how it can be used, improved, and how it can help in everyday life.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
Just a quick headsup, that older posts and images, may have been lost unfortunately, because I made the terrible mistake, when I migrated over from my old blog, that I forgot to download all the images from the remote host.
For lack of options, I deleted the images. :/ Sorry for the inconvencience!

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
Today, I would like to write about how to do HTTPS for a website, without the need to buy a certificate and set it up via your DNS provider. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin.
Abstract What you will achieve by the end of this post: - Every call to HTTP will be redirected to HTTPS via haproxy. - HTTPS will be served with Haproxy and LetsEncrypt as the Certificate provider.</description>

      <description>Intro Hi Folks.
This is a follow up on my previous post about Google Sign-In. In this post we will discover what to do with the information retrieved in the first encounter, which you can find here: Google Sign-In Part 1.
Forewords The Project Everything I did in the first post, and that I&amp;rsquo;m going to do in this example, can be found in this project: Google-OAuth-Go-Sample.
Just to recap, we left off previously on the point where we successfully obtained information about the user, with a secure token and a session initiated with them.</description>

      <description>Intro Hey folks.
So, there is this project called Huginn which I absolutely love.
But the thing is, that for a couple of scrappers ( at least for me ), I don&amp;rsquo;t want to spin up a whole rails app.
Hence, I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with RScrap. Which is a bunch of Ruby scripts run as cron jobs on a raspberry pi. And because I dislike emails as well, and most of the time, I don&amp;rsquo;t read them, I opted for a nicer solution.</description>

      <title>Always Go with []byte</title>

      <description>Another quick reminder&amp;hellip; Always go with []byte if possible. I said it before, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to say it over and over again. It&amp;rsquo;s crucial.
Here is a little code from exercism.io. First, with strings:
package igpay import ( &amp;quot;strings&amp;quot; ) // PigLatin translates reguler old English into awesome pig-latin. func PigLatin(in string) (ret string) { for _, v := range strings.Fields(in) { ret += pigLatin(v) + &amp;quot; &amp;quot; } return strings.</description>

      <description>Quick reminder. If you have a never changing regex in Go, do NOT put it into a frequently called function. ALWAYS put it into a global variable. I&amp;rsquo;ll show you why.
Benchmark for code with a variable in a frequently called function:

      <description>Hi folks.
Quick gotcha, when working with Drupal. If you just freshly installed it, and everything seems to work fine, and yet you are experiencing things like, the admin toolbar is randomly disappearing, or configuration is not saved; than you might not have modrewrite enabled on your apache server.
Because, by default, Drupal has clean url enabled, that needs URL rewriting on apache.
So, step one.

      <description>Though it could be done better, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, but I&amp;rsquo;m actually pretty satisfied with this one. It loops only twice as opposed to filtered ranges and whatnot other solutions to the sieve. I was thinking of rather creating a list and deleting elements from it, but that&amp;rsquo;s already three loops.
Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll do a benchmark later on more solutions.

This is but a simple git hook to run a test in order to ensure you can push. It also ignores the vendor folder if you happen to have on in your directory.
Edit the file under .git/hooks/pre-push.sample and add this at the end before the exit 0.
go test $(go list ./... |grep -v vendor) RESULT=$? if [ $RESULT -ne 0 ]; then echo &amp;quot;Failed test run. Disallowing push.</description>

      <description>Hi Folks.
Previously we created a Minecraft server using Docker. After my server got popular in the family, and a lot of stuff started to pile up on it, as a good IT person, I&amp;rsquo;m backing up the world once in a while.
For that, I&amp;rsquo;m using AWS S3 with the CLI and a little bash script which runs once a week.
The script is really straightforward. I&amp;rsquo;m doing manual versioning, although S3 does provide one out of the box.</description>

Intro Today, I wanted to write about how to create a secure server in a container. Ideally, you don&amp;rsquo;t want to run your server on your own machine. Running it in a container gives you a much needed control and an extra layer of security.
Docker On OSX While on a mac, you have a couple of options to run docker.

So Wercker was not working. After a minor modification it seems to be okay now. The config file needed for it to work looks like this:
box: golang build: steps: - arjen/hugo-build: theme: redlounge deploy: steps: - install-packages: packages: git - leipert/git-push: gh_oauth: $GIT_TOKEN repo: skarlso/skarlso.github.io branch: master basedir: public  The modification is the box type to golang and removed ssh-client from packages.

      <description>Basics Hello folks.
This will be a quick post about how to do CORS with jQuery, Gin in Go with a very simple ajax GET and Json.
I&amp;rsquo;m choosing JSON here because basically I don&amp;rsquo;t really like JSONP. And actually, it&amp;rsquo;s not very complicated to do CORS, it&amp;rsquo;s just hidden enough so that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t become transparent.
First, what is CORS? It&amp;rsquo;s Cross-Platform Resource Sharing. It has been invented so that without your explicit authorization in the header of a request, Javascript can&amp;rsquo;t reach outside of your domain and be potentially harmful to your visitors.</description>

I wanted to share with you my tale of working through the problems with Advent Of Code.
It is a nice tale and there are a few things I learned from it, especially in Go, since I used that solve all of the problems. So, let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
Solving the problems The most important lesson I learned while doing these exercises was, how to solve these problems. A couple of them were simple enough to not have to over think it, but most of them got very tricky.</description>

      <description>Hi folks and a Happy new Year!
Today, I would like to show you some interesting things you can do with channels. Consider the following simple example.
package main import &amp;quot;fmt&amp;quot; func main() { generatedPassword := make(chan int, 100) correctPassword := make(chan int) defer close(generatedPassword) defer close(correctPassword) go passwordIncrement(generatedPassword) go checkPassword(generatedPassword, correctPassword) pass := &amp;lt;-correctPassword fmt.Println(pass) } func checkPassword(input &amp;lt;-chan int, output chan&amp;lt;- int) { for { p := &amp;lt;-input //Introduce lengthy operation here // time.</description>

      <description>Hello Folks.
This is just a quick post on the topic and a reminder for myself and everybody to ALWAYS USE []BYTE INSTEAD OF STRINGS.
[]Byte is marginally faster than a simple Strings. In fact, I would say using []byte should be the standard instead of strings.
Sample code:
package solutions import &amp;quot;fmt&amp;quot; const ( //INPUT input INPUT = &amp;quot;1321131112&amp;quot; //LIMIT limit LIMIT = 50 ) //LookAndSay translates numbers according to Look and Say algo func LookAndSay(s string, c chan string) { charCount := 1 look := &amp;quot;&amp;quot; for i := range s { if i+1 &amp;lt; len(s) { if s[i] == s[i+1] { charCount++ } else { look += fmt.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody!
I wanted to do a sort post about word frequency count. I did it many times now and I was curious as how a recursive solution would perform as opposed to looping.
So I wrote it up quickly and added a few benchmarks with different sized data.
First&amp;hellip;. The code:
var freqMap = make(map[string]int, 0) func countLettersRecursive(s string) string { if len(s) == 0 { return s } freqMap[string(s[0])]++ return countLettersRecursive(s[1:]) } func countLettersLoop(s string) { for _, v := range s { freqMap[string(v)]++ } }  Very simple.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Here is a little something I&amp;rsquo;ve put together, since I&amp;rsquo;m doing it a lot.
Go Development Environment
If I have a project I&amp;rsquo;d like to contribute, like GoHugo, I have to setup a development environment, because most of the times, I&amp;rsquo;m on a Mac. And on OSX things work differently. I like to work in a Linux environment since that&amp;rsquo;s what most of the projects are built on.</description>

      <description>Hello Folks Welcome to my new blog. I decided to move away for a number of reasons, but setting up a static page blog site is very cool if you don&amp;rsquo;t directly use a database. Since posts are just posts and I have a different way of hosting images, this really was just a matter of time.
And Hugo / Github pages provided the tools which made this move possible.</description>

Today, I present to you the One Hundred Day Github Challenge.
The rules are simple:
 Minimum of One commit every day for a Hundred days. Commit has to be meaningful but can be as little as a fix in a Readme.md. Doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if you are on vacation, there are no exceptions. There. Are. No. Exceptions. If you fail a day, you have to start over. No cheating.</description>

If you have the tendency, like me, to forget that you are on the corporate VPN, or leave a certain software open when you bring your laptop to work, this might be helpful to you too.
It&amp;#8217;s a small script which kills a program when you change your Wifi network.

Ever used Job DSL plugin for Jenkins? What is that you say? Well, it&amp;#8217;s TEH most awesome plug-in for Jenkins to have, because you can CODE your job configuration and put it under source control.
Today, however, I&amp;#8217;m not going to write about that because the tutorials on Jenkins JOB DSL are very extensive and very well done. Anyone can pick them up.
Today, I would like to write about a part of it which is even more interesting.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today, I would like to talk about something I came in contact with, and was hard to find a proper answer / solution for it.
So I&amp;#8217;m writing this down to document my findings. Like the title says, this is about aggregating test result with Jenkins, using the plug-in provided. If you, like me, have a pipeline structure which do not work on the same artifact, but do have a upstream-downstream relationship, you will have a hard time configuring and making Aggregation work.</description>

      <description>If you are installing something with Packer and you have Headless enabled(and you are lazy and don&amp;#8217;t want to switch it off), it gets difficult, to see output.
Especially on a windows install the Answer File / Unattended install can be like =&amp;gt; Waiting for SSH&amp;#8230; for about an hour or two! If you are doing this locally fret not. Just start VirtualBox, and watch the Preview section which will display the current state even if it&amp;#8217;s a headless install!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, recently, the tester team talked to me, that their build takes too long, and why is that? A quick look at their configuration and build scripts showed me, that they are actually using a vagrant box, which never gets destroyed or re-started at least. To remedy this problem, I came up with the following solution&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hello folks.
Today, I would like to show you a small script. It installs Java JDK, both version, x86 and 64 bit, silently, and wait for that process to finish.
The wait is necessary because /s on a java install has the nasty habit of running in the background. If you are using a .bat file, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t, than you would use something like: start /w jdk-setup.exe /s. This gets it done, but is ugly.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to write about something interesting and close to me at the moment. I&amp;#8217;m going to setup Go.cd with Docker, and I&amp;#8217;m going to get a Ruby Lotus app running. Let&amp;#8217;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hello folks.
So, some of you know puppet, some of you don&amp;#8217;t. Puppet is a configuration management system. It&amp;#8217;s quite awesome. I like working with it. One of the benefits of puppet is, that I never, ever, EVER have to setup a new laptop from scratch, EVER again.
I&amp;#8217;m writing a puppet manifest file which sets up my new laptop to my liking. I will improve it as I go along.</description>

      <description>Fact is, I&amp;#8217;ve been busy.
I&amp;#8217;ve got a new job as a build engineer. As sort of a devops kind of guy. It&amp;#8217;s extremely interesting considering that I made a career as a tester. Granted, I always was technical, and never really knew my path; but it seems my path is finding me after all.
In the past years, I got betterÂ at Docker, Puppet, Chef, AWS, Packer, Vagrant, Gradle, and a hell of a lot more.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
A small update to this. I created the model now, which is the database design for this app. It&amp;#8217;s very simple, nothing fancy. Also, I&amp;#8217;m writing the app with Python 3 from now on.
Here is the model now:
  from django.db import models from django.contrib.auth.models import User &amp;nbsp; # Create your models here. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; class Item&amp;#40;models.Model&amp;#41;: name = models.CharField&amp;#40;max_length=100, default=&#34;Item&#34;&amp;#41; damage = models.IntegerField&amp;#40;default=&amp;#41; defense = models.</description>

&lt;p&gt;Continuing where we left off with the Django RPG project. Next up is implementing a rudimentary registration and adding the ability to create a character. Maybe even, design the database through django&amp;#8217;s modelling.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last time, we tried to implement a little RPG of mine using Meteor, which failed miserably. This time we are going to try and use Django. Let&amp;#8217;s have at it, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hi folks.
Just a small script which calculates your distance from a lever focal point if you know your weight, the object&amp;#8217;s weight and the object&amp;#8217;s and the distance the object has from the focal point of the lever.
Like this:
This script will give you D1. And this is how it will look like in doing so:
So, in order for me (77kg) to lift an object of 80kg which is on a, by default, 1 meter long lever, I have to stand back ~1.</description>

I kind of like math. So, I have this book:
It&amp;#8217;s 1400 pages long and basically, has everything in it. It&amp;#8217;s a rather exhaustive book. Hence, my plan is to finish the book by the end of 2015 and write a couple of python scripts that calculate something interesting.
For example, Newton&amp;#8217;s law of cooling how I learned it is:</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to take you on a journey I fought myself through in order to write a python android app, which gets you a random problem from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sphere Judge Online&lt;/a&gt;.Â Then you can mark it as solved and it will be stored as such, and you can move on to the next problem.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my previous post, I was getting ready to enjoy some time with the JavaScript web framework Meteor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I would like to bring it to a bit of overdrive. See, how re-factoring works on a larger scale model with multiple pages. And how it can organize assets, such as, images, multiple CSS, some plugins, you know, ordinary web stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My choice is: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meteor.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt;. Looks interesting enough and it was recommended by a friend of mine. So, let&amp;#8217;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s face the horrible truth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It&amp;#8217;s rare / never happens that a manager / scrum master / product owner actually reads your cucumber test cases.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I throw my grudge out of the window against Scala and try something with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got my hands on a fairly new book, called: &amp;#8220;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Scala-Practical-Functional-Programming/dp/1449367933/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1422340157&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=learning+scala+a+practical&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learning Scala: Practical Functional Programming for the JVM&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;. Turns out to be a rather fun book to read. And Jason Swartz has a nice way of writing. So I wanted to play around with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.playframework.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Play 2 Framework&lt;/a&gt;. ItÂ now comes packaged inÂ &lt;a href=&#34;https://typesafe.com/get-started&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Activator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I would like to write about little observation I made along the way of being a tester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The title says it all. I think Testers, are like scientists. I would go even further, and say: Testers, are scientists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us see how the two compare.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I&amp;#8217;d like to write about the expressiveness of a Test. I think that it&amp;#8217;s very important to write understandable and expressive tests. In older times I was studying novel writing. There is a rule which a novel needs to follow. It goes something like this: &amp;#8220;A novel needs to lead its reader and make him understand in the simplest way what&amp;#8217;s going on, with whom and why?&amp;#8221;. In other words, it&amp;#8217;s not a puzzle. It should be obvious what the test is trying to do and it should not require the reader to try and solve it in order to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s an 8 week course on algorithmic programming with fun little projects. I&amp;#8217;d like to write down some of my solutions with pseudo code for my own better understanding and for the sake of sharing knowledge. I won&amp;#8217;t, however, share full projects since that would be against the honour code.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Folks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So last I was writing about why a tester should learn Javascript. Today I would like to write about why a tester should learn SQL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There, I said it. I know many people, especially testers, don&amp;#8217;t like SQL. They view it as a monster best be avoided. Something only Database people will know. Something which is so scary and ugly, nobody really wants it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I will give you a couple of good reasons why you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be afraid of SQL. And why you should welcome it as your best friend and partner in crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to write about a very interesting topic, I hope. So let&amp;#8217;s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the title already suggests, I&amp;#8217;m writing about why a front-end tester should learn at least a little bit about JavaScripting and the DOM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ohhh and contrary to the belief CSP ( Content Security Policy ) will &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; be the death of such scripts. There are white-lists and workarounds and exclusions which can be implemented in order to allow local JavaScripting to continue. So don&amp;#8217;t fret&amp;#8230; Read on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to tell you about a little conversation I had with my friend Adrian.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic was about how, when and what to log during a testing session regarding a story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#8217;s see what came out of that talk&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello Everybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I would like to write a few words about Chrome&amp;#8217;s Search Engines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re probably already using it for a couple of things, like Google, or Amazon searches or YouTube or anything like that. But are you using it to access environments and testing tools faster, with queries?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Hello.
So let&amp;#8217;s clarify this&amp;#8230; They rarely or ever work if you are a beginner blogger. If you have a reputation it will probably work or people will use it as a reference. But I&amp;#8217;m skipping ahead.
Beginnings
When you are a beginner blog writer you want to get out as much content as possible. Write mostly relevant things and interesting information because you need to establish a name for yourself.</description>

      <description>Hello guys.
I&amp;#8217;d like to share a little something with you. It&amp;#8217;s what I cooked up in Python to check an unknown number of content items in a web application.
Basically the script runs from a script folder under Grails. It goes through all the configured folders where there is static content like images, javascript, css and so on and so forth.
And then with curl it calls these items up in using their respective paths&amp;#8217;.</description>

      <description>Hello.
Today I would like to write about something very interesting to you folks.
It&amp;#8217;s a common remember / recall technique called the Method of loci. Otherwise known as the Memory Palace. A very popular usage can be seen in the episodes of Sherlock Holmes from BBC. He uses it often.
What is the Method of loci?
As the Wikipedia page write so properly&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;In basic terms, it is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information.</description>

      <description>Hello,
So Vim is a very powerful editing tool and has lots and lots of potential in regarding plug-ins.
It has years and years of gathered knowledge and extensions and can virtually do anything you want. But that&amp;#8217;s not even it&amp;#8217;s final form&amp;#8230;
The real power of Vim lies in navigation and manipulation. The ability to navigate and edit without the use of arrow keys or mouse chops of a large portion of your time which you didn&amp;#8217;t even realize you are wasting until you try it without it.</description>

I&amp;#8217;d like to explain a lot about a topic that is very near my heart. If your job is in an office you will understand this.
Why offices?
So why are we sitting together in one big place cramped up with 20-300 other people? Why bother the catering and the ventilation and what not to accommodate these people at one place? Why not just leave them be and let them work at home?</description>

Today I would like to write about something very interesting I&amp;#8217;m seeing all over the place from recruiters. And that is tool requirements from developers.
For words
So why is it a problem that in a requirement from a developer there a lots of these:
&amp;#8211; DB2
&amp;#8211; QTP
&amp;#8211; Ranorex
&amp;#8211; Eclipse ( yes I saw a few of these&amp;#8230; )

Today I would like to talk to you about something interesting I was talking about with a developer friend.
We talked about the quality of test code.
He said&amp;#8230; And I will quote this&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;Why should we care? It&amp;#8217;s not production code. We aren&amp;#8217;t giving it to the customer.&amp;#8221;

I&amp;#8217;d like to present you a small idea I was working on recently. The reminiscence of an old program. From the view point of the program.

      <description>Hey folks.
I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day.
If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It&amp;#8217;s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know&amp;#8230; It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody.
I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.
Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm
You can try something like that:
  @After //this is cucumbers @Afters public static void afterExecution&amp;#40;Scenario scenario&amp;#41; &amp;#123; logger.log&amp;#40;&#34;The status of the test is: &#34; + scenario.getStatus&amp;#40;&amp;#41;&amp;#41;; &amp;#125;     But that isn&amp;#8217;t giving you too much now is it?</description>

So let&amp;#8217;s begin.

Some History
I&amp;#8217;ve been a tester for a long time now. I&amp;#8217;ve been up and down and down and up. I struggled for a very long time until I became somebody who I am today. And I still have many things to learn ahead of me.

Today I would like to show you what you need to become a Testing expert.
If you had noticed I deliberately left out the word Software. Why? Because becoming and expert in Testing Anything has the same root as becoming an expert to test software. And for that let me take you back to a Galaxy Far Far Away in Time AND Space.

Also something that I can see in the world repeating over and over again. Not just in Software business but also in History in Human nature in Physics and Systems.
So let&amp;#8217;s see what I&amp;#8217;m talking about.
What is Chaos?
Chaos is a state of utter confusion. Chaos is the opposite of order.</description>

Testing Exploration Adventure Session is about&amp;#8230; Testing! There. No real surprise, eh? TEAS has it&amp;#8217;s roots in RPGs. Role Playing Games. If you ever heard or read about M.A.G.U.S. or the more known Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons you will have a better understanding of the concept behind this phenomena.</description>

      <description>Hello folks.
Today I want to write about a little trick I learned.
If you are working with legacy code and you don&amp;#8217;t have the chance to eliminate core design problems, you can use this little pattern to help you out.
Problem
Problem is that you have a class that has a gazillion collaborators and at some point in time one of the clever devs thought it would be a cool idea to do dependancy injection via the constructor.</description>

      <description>Hello everybody.
So yesterday I was on a little gathering called Coderetreat.
If you look at the link you can read everything about it. If not, I&amp;#8217;ve provided a short description.
What it is about?
So what is codereatreat about? In short it&amp;#8217;s about programmers getting together and honing and practicing there skills in order to become more at what they are doing. It&amp;#8217;s a practice run with great people. TDDing one problem the whole day long with constantly applied constraints.</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
Today I want to write to you about learning something with a visual mind. There are a gazillion posts out there that tell you how to learn something with a visual mind. However, there are only a few actually describing how to learn something as complicated and logical as programming. How do you draw up a function? How do you draw up a cycle or a structure?
Actually these are really easy.</description>

      <description>So today at 8-12PM I had a great session with two friends of mine. It was awesome. Like a mini code retreat.
We set down in a musky bar, drank wine and beer and cider, and decided to practice some TDD with the well known problem of Conway&amp;#8217;s Game of Life. This challenge is really interesting. I never done it before, ever. So it was a really good practice for me.</description>

      <description>Aka, what you can do if you are facing and unknown framework / system you have to work with for quite some time.
Get intimate
You are going to live with this system for a while. The best thing you can do is getting to know it better. You have to get it to know like you would approche a fine lady. You have to ask it questions look after it, how it feels how its day was.</description>

      <description>My solution to the String Wrap Kata. The goal is to have it wrap a text on a given column width.
It is not the best solution but this is my first try. I did it with TDD so there were tests first, which I&amp;#8217;m not going to copy in..

      <description>Hi everybody.
Today I want to talk to you about.. Well.. How to read a professional book for slow learners without too much waste of time.
Let us start at the&amp;#8230; well&amp;#8230; the beginning. How do you normally read a book if you want to memorize it properly. You read it once and then re read the whole thing again until it gets in your head? Or do you have another strategy?</description>

      <description>Hi.
Today I want to talk about a common problem in many frameworks I encountered over the course of my carrier as a Java dev / automation engineer, whatnot.
Throwing Exceptions. That is in your method you have something like this:
  1   public void insertMethodNameHere&amp;#40;String param&amp;#41; throws Exception &amp;#123;&amp;#125;     This is bad. And I will tell you in short forms why.
Hides exceptions</description>

      <description>Hi folks.
I want to write a little bit about writing a professional blog.
Early steps
Let&amp;#8217;s first talk about what you understand about professional blog. It&amp;#8217;s either a semi professional one, that mixes life with professionalism, like chess, programming, testing, painting, drawing, engineering whatever your profession is. Or it can be a purely professional one without your life getting involved in it.
Either way you have to decide at the beginning.</description>

      <description>Hi!
I&amp;#8217;ve seen this many times over and over again. Many people have wrote books about it already. Like Uncle Bob&amp;#8217;s Clean Code. Like Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. What makes your code understandable to others.
Is it Comments?
No. It&amp;#8217;s not comments. If your code could be read properly you wouldn&amp;#8217;t need comments to explain what it does. Like Uncle Bob said. A good code doesn&amp;#8217;t contain surprises.</description>

      <description>Hi guys.
Today I want to talk about a little adventure I had yesterday night. It was quite the fun and frustration too. But neither comes without the other when it&amp;#8217;s about linux.
So let us see what the problem is at hand. The problem machine is a Dell Inspiron N5110 with Nvidia card number one: GeForce GT 525M. And number two: Integrated. Optimus for the win.
So how windows is handling this is actually with a software called Optimus.</description>

      <description>Hello chumps.
Today I want to write about jms connection testing with a small framework. I wrote a small thing using a factory object model. It&amp;#8217;s a lead, a proof of concept. You can use this to go onward.
First, let&amp;#8217;s begin with the JMS connection it self.
JMS Connection
First rule of thumb is: &amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t wait for a response when dealing with JMS queues.&amp;#8221; How so? Because, a JMS queue is asynchronous so you wont get back anything.</description>

Just&amp;#8230; don&amp;#8217;t. There are a lot of possibilities to use configuration in Java. Java property files. Xml. Xml serialization. CSV file. Whatever suits you best, but this?</description>

      <description>Hello Dear Visitor.
Welcome to the ramblings of a software test engineer who thinks that he is a tester but feels like a developer but works as a tester but wants to learn programming like a developer&amp;#8230; And so on and so fort.
I will make a journey that has been done by many automation testers. The journey when you decide to step oneÂ forward. A friend of mine told me that it is good that a tester learns proper programming and that more should do so.</description>

The name of the plugin is WP-Syntax. The trick is to edit the page in plain HTML. Because the WordPress word editor screws up the &amp;lt;&amp;gt; tags. But surely you already knew that&amp;#8230;</description>
