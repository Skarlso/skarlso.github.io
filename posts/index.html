            	Basics Hello folks. This will be a quick post about how to do CORS with jQuery, Gin in Go with a very simple ajax GET and Json. I&rsquo;m choosing JSON here because basically I don&rsquo;t really like JSONP. And actually, it&rsquo;s not very complicated to do CORS, it&rsquo;s just hidden enough so that it doesn&rsquo;t become transparent. First, what is CORS? It&rsquo;s Cross-Platform Resource Sharing. It has been invented so that without your explicit authorization in the header of a request, Javascript can&rsquo;t reach outside of your domain and be potentially harmful to your visitors.

            	Hello folks. I wanted to share with you my tale of working through the problems with Advent Of Code. It is a nice tale and there are a few things I learned from it, especially in Go, since I used that solve all of the problems. So, let&rsquo;s get started. Solving the problems The most important lesson I learned while doing these exercises was, how to solve these problems. A couple of them were simple enough to not have to over think it, but most of them got very tricky.

Consider the following simple example. package main import &quot;fmt&quot; func main() { generatedPassword := make(chan int, 100) correctPassword := make(chan int) defer close(generatedPassword) defer close(correctPassword) go passwordIncrement(generatedPassword) go checkPassword(generatedPassword, correctPassword) pass := &lt;-correctPassword fmt.Println(pass) } func checkPassword(input &lt;-chan int, output chan&lt;- int) { for { p := &lt;-input //Introduce lengthy operation here // time.Sleep(time.Second) fmt.Println(&quot;Checking p:&quot;, p) if p &gt; 100000 { output &lt;- p } } } func passwordIncrement(out chan&lt;- int) { p := 0 for { p++ out &lt;- p } } The premise is as follows.

            	Hello Folks. This is just a quick post on the topic and a reminder for myself and everybody to ALWAYS USE []BYTE INSTEAD OF STRINGS. []Byte is marginally faster than a simple Strings. In fact, I would say using []byte should be the standard instead of strings. Sample code: package solutions import &quot;fmt&quot; const ( //INPUT input INPUT = &quot;1321131112&quot; //LIMIT limit LIMIT = 50 ) //LookAndSay translates numbers according to Look and Say algo func LookAndSay(s string, c chan string) { charCount := 1 look := &quot;&quot; for i := range s { if i+1 &lt; len(s) { if s[i] == s[i+1] { charCount++ } else { look += fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%d%s&quot;, charCount, string(s[i])) charCount = 1 } } else { look += fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%d%s&quot;, charCount, string(s[i])) } } c &lt;- look } //GetLengthOfLookAndSay Retrieve the Length of a lookandsay done Limit times func GetLengthOfLookAndSay() { c := make(chan string, 0) go LookAndSay(INPUT, c) finalString := &lt;-c for i := 0; i &lt;= LIMIT-2; i++ { go LookAndSay(finalString, c) finalString = &lt;-c // fmt.Println(finalString) } fmt.Println(&quot;Lenght of final String:&quot;, len(finalString)) } This, with the limit raised to 50 run for ~1 hour.

            	Hello Folks. This is just a quick post on the topic and a reminder for myself and everybody to ALWAYS USE []BYTE INSTEAD OF STRINGS. []Byte is marginally faster than a simple Strings. In fact, I would say using []byte should be the standard instead of strings. Sample code: package solutions import &quot;fmt&quot; const ( //INPUT input INPUT = &quot;1321131112&quot; //LIMIT limit LIMIT = 50 ) //LookAndSay translates numbers according to Look and Say algo func LookAndSay(s string, c chan string) { charCount := 1 look := &quot;&quot; for i := range s { if i+1 &lt; len(s) { if s[i] == s[i+1] { charCount++ } else { look += fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%d%s&quot;, charCount, string(s[i])) charCount = 1 } } else { look += fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%d%s&quot;, charCount, string(s[i])) } } c &lt;- look } //GetLengthOfLookAndSay Retrieve the Length of a lookandsay done Limit times func GetLengthOfLookAndSay() { c := make(chan string, 0) go LookAndSay(INPUT, c) finalString := &lt;-c for i := 0; i &lt;= LIMIT-2; i++ { go LookAndSay(finalString, c) finalString = &lt;-c // fmt.Println(finalString) } fmt.Println(&quot;Lenght of final String:&quot;, len(finalString)) } This, with the limit raised to 50 run for ~1 hour.

            	Hello everybody! I wanted to do a sort post about word frequency count. I did it many times now and I was curious as how a recursive solution would perform as opposed to looping. So I wrote it up quickly and added a few benchmarks with different sized data. First&hellip;. The code: var freqMap = make(map[string]int, 0) func countLettersRecursive(s string) string { if len(s) == 0 { return s } freqMap[string(s[0])]++ return countLettersRecursive(s[1:]) } func countLettersLoop(s string) { for _, v := range s { freqMap[string(v)]++ } } Very simple.

            	Hello folks. Here is a little something I&rsquo;ve put together, since I&rsquo;m doing it a lot. Go Development Environment If I have a project I&rsquo;d like to contribute, like GoHugo, I have to setup a development environment, because most of the times, I&rsquo;m on a Mac. And on OSX things work differently. I like to work in a Linux environment since that&rsquo;s what most of the projects are built on. So here you go.

            	Hello Folks Welcome to my new blog. I decided to move away for a number of reasons, but setting up a static page blog site is very cool if you don&rsquo;t directly use a database. Since posts are just posts and I have a different way of hosting images, this really was just a matter of time. And Hugo / Github pages provided the tools which made this move possible. Also, I love writing this post in Markdown.

            	Hello folks. Today, I present to you the One Hundred Day Github Challenge. The rules are simple: Minimum of One commit every day for a Hundred days. Commit has to be meaningful but can be as little as a fix in a Readme.md. Doesn&#8217;t matter if you are on vacation, there are no exceptions. There. Are. No. Exceptions. If you fail a day, you have to start over. No cheating. You only cheat yourself, so this is really up to you.

            	Hi Folks. Ever used Job DSL plugin for Jenkins? What is that you say? Well, it&#8217;s TEH most awesome plug-in for Jenkins to have, because you can CODE your job configuration and put it under source control. Today, however, I&#8217;m not going to write about that because the tutorials on Jenkins JOB DSL are very extensive and very well done. Anyone can pick them up. Today, I would like to write about a part of it which is even more interesting.

            	Hello folks. Today, I would like to talk about something I came in contact with, and was hard to find a proper answer / solution for it. So I&#8217;m writing this down to document my findings. Like the title says, this is about aggregating test result with Jenkins, using the plug-in provided. If you, like me, have a pipeline structure which do not work on the same artifact, but do have a upstream-downstream relationship, you will have a hard time configuring and making Aggregation work.

            	I used to have great ideas on the toilet, but I no longer do. And I would like to reflect on that. So this is not going to be a technical post, rather some ramblings. I already had a post similar to this one, but I failed to follow up on it, and now I&#8217;m re-visiting the question. With technology on the rise, embedded systems, chips, augmented biology and information being available at our fingertips, I have but one concern.

            	If you are installing something with Packer and you have Headless enabled(and you are lazy and don&#8217;t want to switch it off), it gets difficult, to see output. Especially on a windows install the Answer File / Unattended install can be like =&gt; Waiting for SSH&#8230; for about an hour or two! If you are doing this locally fret not. Just start VirtualBox, and watch the Preview section which will display the current state even if it&#8217;s a headless install!

            	<p>So, recently, the tester team talked to me, that their build takes too long, and why is that? A quick look at their configuration and build scripts showed me, that they are actually using a vagrant box, which never gets destroyed or re-started at least. To remedy this problem, I came up with the following solution&#8230;</p>

            	Hello folks. Today, I would like to show you a small script. It installs Java JDK, both version, x86 and 64 bit, silently, and wait for that process to finish. The wait is necessary because /s on a java install has the nasty habit of running in the background. If you are using a .bat file, you shouldn&#8217;t, than you would use something like: start /w jdk-setup.exe /s. This gets it done, but is ugly.

            	Hello folks. So, some of you know puppet, some of you don&#8217;t. Puppet is a configuration management system. It&#8217;s quite awesome. I like working with it. One of the benefits of puppet is, that I never, ever, EVER have to setup a new laptop from scratch, EVER again. I&#8217;m writing a puppet manifest file which sets up my new laptop to my liking. I will improve it as I go along.

It&#8217;s extremely interesting considering that I made a career as a tester. Granted, I always was technical, and never really knew my path; but it seems my path is finding me after all. In the past years, I got better at Docker, Puppet, Chef, AWS, Packer, Vagrant, Gradle, and a hell of a lot more.

            	<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>So last time, we tried to implement a little RPG of mine using Meteor, which failed miserably. This time we are going to try and use Django. Let&#8217;s have at it, shall we?</p>

            	Hi folks. Just a small script which calculates your distance from a lever focal point if you know your weight, the object&#8217;s weight and the object&#8217;s and the distance the object has from the focal point of the lever. Like this: This script will give you D1. And this is how it will look like in doing so: [][2] So, in order for me (77kg) to lift an object of 80kg which is on a, by default, 1 meter long lever, I have to stand back ~1.03meters.

            	Let&#8217;s talk about plans. It&#8217;s good to have one. For example, I have a plan for this year. I kind of like math. So, I have this book: [][1] It&#8217;s 1400 pages long and basically, has everything in it. It&#8217;s a rather exhaustive book. Hence, my plan is to finish the book by the end of 2015 and write a couple of python scripts that calculate something interesting. For example, Newton&#8217;s law of cooling how I learned it is: Where k =&gt; a material&#8217;s surface based constant.

            	<p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>Today I would like to take you on a journey I fought myself through in order to write a python android app, which gets you a random problem from <a href="http://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/" target="_blank">Sphere Judge Online</a>. Then you can mark it as solved and it will be stored as such, and you can move on to the next problem. With the words of Neil deGrasse Tyson, Come with Me!</p>

<p>Today, I would like to write about little observation I made along the way of being a tester.</p>

<p>The title says it all. I think Testers, are like scientists. I would go even further, and say: Testers, are scientists.</p>

<p>Let us see how the two compare.</p>

            	<p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>This time I&#8217;d like to write about the expressiveness of a Test. I think that it&#8217;s very important to write understandable and expressive tests. In older times I was studying novel writing. There is a rule which a novel needs to follow. It goes something like this: &#8220;A novel needs to lead its reader and make him understand in the simplest way what&#8217;s going on, with whom and why?&#8221;. In other words, it&#8217;s not a puzzle. It should be obvious what the test is trying to do and it should not require the reader to try and solve it in order to understand it.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;d like to write a little bit about a python course I did.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an 8 week course on algorithmic programming with fun little projects. I&#8217;d like to write down some of my solutions with pseudo code for my own better understanding and for the sake of sharing knowledge. I won&#8217;t, however, share full projects since that would be against the honour code.</p>

<p>So last I was writing about why a tester should learn Javascript. Today I would like to write about why a tester should learn SQL.</p>

<p>There, I said it. I know many people, especially testers, don&#8217;t like SQL. They view it as a monster best be avoided. Something only Database people will know. Something which is so scary and ugly, nobody really wants it.</p>

<p>But I will give you a couple of good reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of SQL. And why you should welcome it as your best friend and partner in crime.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go.</p>

<p>Today I would like to write about a very interesting topic, I hope. So let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<p>As the title already suggests, I&#8217;m writing about why a front-end tester should learn at least a little bit about JavaScripting and the DOM.</p>

<p>Ohhh and contrary to the belief CSP ( Content Security Policy ) will <strong>not</strong> be the death of such scripts. There are white-lists and workarounds and exclusions which can be implemented in order to allow local JavaScripting to continue. So don&#8217;t fret&#8230; Read on.</p>

            	<p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>Today I would like to tell you about a little conversation I had with my friend Adrian.</p>

<p>The topic was about how, when and what to log during a testing session regarding a story.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s see what came out of that talk&#8230;</p>

<p>Today I would like to write a few words about Chrome&#8217;s Search Engines.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re probably already using it for a couple of things, like Google, or Amazon searches or YouTube or anything like that. But are you using it to access environments and testing tools faster, with queries?</p>

            	Hello. So let&#8217;s clarify this&#8230; They rarely or ever work if you are a beginner blogger. If you have a reputation it will probably work or people will use it as a reference. But I&#8217;m skipping ahead. Beginnings When you are a beginner blog writer you want to get out as much content as possible. Write mostly relevant things and interesting information because you need to establish a name for yourself.

            	Hello guys. I&#8217;d like to share a little something with you. It&#8217;s what I cooked up in Python to check an unknown number of content items in a web application. Basically the script runs from a script folder under Grails. It goes through all the configured folders where there is static content like images, javascript, css and so on and so forth. And then with curl it calls these items up in using their respective paths&#8217;.

            	Hello. Today I would like to write about something very interesting to you folks. It&#8217;s a common remember / recall technique called the Method of loci. Otherwise known as the Memory Palace. A very popular usage can be seen in the episodes of Sherlock Holmes from BBC. He uses it often. What is the Method of loci? As the Wikipedia page write so properly&#8230;&#8221;In basic terms, it is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information.&#8221; This says all&#8230; So&#8230; How does it work?

            	Hello, So Vim is a very powerful editing tool and has lots and lots of potential in regarding plug-ins. It has years and years of gathered knowledge and extensions and can virtually do anything you want. But that&#8217;s not even it&#8217;s final form&#8230; The real power of Vim lies in navigation and manipulation. The ability to navigate and edit without the use of arrow keys or mouse chops of a large portion of your time which you didn&#8217;t even realize you are wasting until you try it without it.

            	Hello everybody. I&#8217;d like to explain a lot about a topic that is very near my heart. If your job is in an office you will understand this. Why offices? So why are we sitting together in one big place cramped up with 20-300 other people? Why bother the catering and the ventilation and what not to accommodate these people at one place? Why not just leave them be and let them work at home?

            	Hello folks! Today I would like to write about something very interesting I&#8217;m seeing all over the place from recruiters. And that is tool requirements from developers. For words So why is it a problem that in a requirement from a developer there a lots of these: &#8211; DB2 &#8211; QTP &#8211; Ranorex &#8211; Eclipse ( yes I saw a few of these&#8230; ) &#8211; Hibernate &#8211; Grails &#8211; Ruby on Rails &#8211; &#8230; Long answer The answer is simple yet it has it&#8217;s roots very deep in the recruitment and the way companies work.

I&#8217;m unsure of this date as my subroutines and algorithms have been re-written so many times that if it weren&#8217;t for my backups I wouldn&#8217;t remember a thing.

            	Hello everybody. I&#8217;ve been messing around with sublime for some time now. And been using it to write entires and stuff. So here I was thinking why the hell I should not us it as my main blog entry writer. And being the curious guy I was I thought that creating a plugin that let&#8217;s you submit your post from your favorite editor is just the thing I need. So without any further ado here it is&#8230; The wordpress blog entry submitter plugin for sublime text: Sublime WordPress Plugin Please enjoy.

            	Hey folks. I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day. If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It&#8217;s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know&#8230; It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.

            	Hello everybody. I would like to show you a gem today that I found out. Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm You can try something like that: @After //this is cucumbers @Afters public static void afterExecution&#40;Scenario scenario&#41; &#123; logger.log&#40;"The status of the test is: " + scenario.getStatus&#40;&#41;&#41;; &#125; But that isn&#8217;t giving you too much now is it? And the API of scenario is as small as it can get.

            	Hi folks. I attended a 4 day course of Groovy and Grails and this is my attempt at writing up a summary to see how much I retained. I&#8217;ll try to do this from the top of my head without peaking at my notes. So let&#8217;s begin. Introductions First of all, introductions. The course was held by Peter Ledbrook. He is the guy who wrote Grails in Action. He is awesome, go check him out.

            	Hello folks. Today I&#8217;d like to share with you some of the experiences I had as a beginner tester. I hope it sets you off on a path to enlightenment and leaves you off with a good appetite for testing. Shall we begin then? The early days It was 2004 when I finished school and started working at my first company. I finished as a software developer which is kind of an exaggeration since I only finished a 2 years course of it.

Because becoming and expert in Testing Anything has the same root as becoming an expert to test software. And for that let me take you back to a Galaxy Far Far Away in Time AND Space.

Testing Exploration Adventure Session is about&#8230; Testing! There. No real surprise, eh? TEAS has it&#8217;s roots in RPGs. Role Playing Games. If you ever heard or read about M.A.G.U.S. or the more known Dungeons &amp; Dragons you will have a better understanding of the concept behind this phenomena.

            	Hello folks. Today I want to write about a little trick I learned. If you are working with legacy code and you don&#8217;t have the chance to eliminate core design problems, you can use this little pattern to help you out. Problem Problem is that you have a class that has a gazillion collaborators and at some point in time one of the clever devs thought it would be a cool idea to do dependancy injection via the constructor.

What it is about? So what is codereatreat about? In short it&#8217;s about programmers getting together and honing and practicing there skills in order to become more at what they are doing. It&#8217;s a practice run with great people. TDDing one problem the whole day long with constantly applied constraints.

            	Hi folks. Today I want to write to you about learning something with a visual mind. There are a gazillion posts out there that tell you how to learn something with a visual mind. However, there are only a few actually describing how to learn something as complicated and logical as programming. How do you draw up a function? How do you draw up a cycle or a structure? Actually these are really easy.

            	So today at 8-12PM I had a great session with two friends of mine. It was awesome. Like a mini code retreat. We set down in a musky bar, drank wine and beer and cider, and decided to practice some TDD with the well known problem of Conway&#8217;s Game of Life. This challenge is really interesting. I never done it before, ever. So it was a really good practice for me.

Let us start at the&#8230; well&#8230; the beginning. How do you normally read a book if you want to memorize it properly. You read it once and then re read the whole thing again until it gets in your head? Or do you have another strategy?

            	Hi. Today I want to talk about a common problem in many frameworks I encountered over the course of my carrier as a Java dev / automation engineer, whatnot. Throwing Exceptions. That is in your method you have something like this: 1 public void insertMethodNameHere&#40;String param&#41; throws Exception &#123;&#125; This is bad. And I will tell you in short forms why. Hides exceptions This one should be obvious. When a method throws exception you can never be sure what kind of exceptions it handles.

            	Hi folks. I want to write a little bit about writing a professional blog. Early steps Let&#8217;s first talk about what you understand about professional blog. It&#8217;s either a semi professional one, that mixes life with professionalism, like chess, programming, testing, painting, drawing, engineering whatever your profession is. Or it can be a purely professional one without your life getting involved in it. Either way you have to decide at the beginning.

            	Hi! I&#8217;ve seen this many times over and over again. Many people have wrote books about it already. Like Uncle Bob&#8217;s Clean Code. Like Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. What makes your code understandable to others. Is it Comments? No. It&#8217;s not comments. If your code could be read properly you wouldn&#8217;t need comments to explain what it does. Like Uncle Bob said. A good code doesn&#8217;t contain surprises.

            	Hi guys. Today I want to talk about a little adventure I had yesterday night. It was quite the fun and frustration too. But neither comes without the other when it&#8217;s about linux. So let us see what the problem is at hand. The problem machine is a Dell Inspiron N5110 with Nvidia card number one: GeForce GT 525M. And number two: Integrated. Optimus for the win. So how windows is handling this is actually with a software called Optimus.

            	Hello chumps. Today I want to write about jms connection testing with a small framework. I wrote a small thing using a factory object model. It&#8217;s a lead, a proof of concept. You can use this to go onward. First, let&#8217;s begin with the JMS connection it self. JMS Connection First rule of thumb is: &#8220;Don&#8217;t wait for a response when dealing with JMS queues.&#8221; How so? Because, a JMS queue is asynchronous so you wont get back anything.

            	When I see something like this: 1 2 3 4 5 6 public class Config &#123; public static final string DATABASELINK = "linkhere"; . . . &#125; It sends a small, but chilling shiver down my spine. Just&#8230; don&#8217;t. There are a lot of possibilities to use configuration in Java. Java property files. Xml. Xml serialization. CSV file. Whatever suits you best, but this? DON&#8217;T!

            	Hello Dear Visitor. Welcome to the ramblings of a software test engineer who thinks that he is a tester but feels like a developer but works as a tester but wants to learn programming like a developer&#8230; And so on and so fort. I will make a journey that has been done by many automation testers. The journey when you decide to step one forward. A friend of mine told me that it is good that a tester learns proper programming and that more should do so.

The name of the plugin is WP-Syntax. The trick is to edit the page in plain HTML. Because the WordPress word editor screws up the &lt;&gt; tags. But surely you already knew that&#8230;
