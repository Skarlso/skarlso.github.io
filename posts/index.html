<p>Just a quick headsup, that older posts and images, may have been lost unfortunately, because I made the terrible mistake, when I
migrated over from my old blog, that I forgot to download all the images from the remote host.</p>

<p>For lack of options, I deleted the images. :/ Sorry for the inconvencience!</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Today, I would like to write about how to do HTTPS for a website, without the need to buy a certificate and set it up via your DNS provider. Let&rsquo;s begin.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>What you will achieve by the end of this post:
- Every call to HTTP will be redirected to HTTPS via <a href="https://www.haproxy.com">haproxy</a>.
- HTTPS will be served with Haproxy and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">LetsEncrypt</a> as the Certificate provider.
- Automatically update the certificate before its expiration.
- No need for IPTable rules to route 8080 to 80.
- Traffic to and from your page will be encrypted.
- This all will cost you nothing.</p>

<p>I will use a static website generator for this called <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> which, if you know me, is my favorite generator tool. These instructions
are for haproxy and hugo, if you wish to use apache and nginx for example, you&rsquo;ll have to dig for the corresponding settings for letsencrypt and certbot.</p>

<h1 id="what-you-will-need">What You Will Need</h1>

<h2 id="hugo">Hugo</h2>

<p>You will need hugo, which can be downloaded from here: <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. A simple website will be enough. For themes, you can take a look
at the humongous list located here: <a href="http://themes.gohugo.io/">HugoThemes</a>.</p>

<h2 id="haproxy">Haproxy</h2>

<p>Haproxy can be found here: <a href="https://www.haproxy.com">Haproxy</a>. There are a number of options to install haproxy. I chose a simple
<code>apt-get install haproxy</code>.</p>

<h2 id="let-s-encrypt">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</h2>

<p>Information about Let&rsquo;s Encrypt can be found on their website here: <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</a>.
Let&rsquo;s Encrypt&rsquo;s client is now called <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">Certbot</a> which is used to generate the certificates. To get the latest code
you either clone the repository <a href="https://github.com/certbot/certbot">Certbot</a>, or use an auto downloader:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">user@webserver:~$ wget https://dl.eff.org/certbot-auto
user@webserver:~$ chmod a+x ./certbot-auto
user@webserver:~$ ./certbot-auto --help
</code></pre>

<p>Either way, I&rsquo;m using the current latest version: <em>v0.11.1</em>.</p>

<h2 id="sudo">Sudo</h2>

<p>This goes without saying, but that these operations will require you to have sudo privileges. I suggest staying in sudo for ease of use.
This means that the commands, I&rsquo;ll write here, will assume you are in <code>sudo su</code> mode thus no <code>sudo</code> prefix will be used.</p>

<h2 id="portforwarding">Portforwarding</h2>

<p>In order for your website to work under https this guide assumes that you have port <em>80</em> and <em>443</em> open on your router / network security group.</p>

<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>

<h2 id="single-server-environment">Single Server Environment</h2>

<p>It is possible for haproxy, certbot and your website to run on designated servers. Haproxy&rsquo;s abilities allows to define multiple server sources.
In this guide, my haproxy, website and certbot will all run on the same server; thus redirecting to 127.0.0.1 and local ips. This is more
convenient, because otherwise the haproxy IP would have to be a permanent local/remote ip. Or an automated script would have to be setup which is
notified upon IP change and updates the ip records.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-certificate">Creating a Certificate</h2>

<p>Diving in, the first thing you will require is a certificate. A certificate will allow for encrypted traffic and an authenticated website.
Let&rsquo;s Encrypt which is basically functioning as an independent, free, automated CA (Certificate Authority). Usually,
the process would be to pay a CA to give you a signed, generated certificate for your website, and you would have to set that up with your DNS
provider. Let&rsquo;s Encrypt has that all automated, and free of any charge. Neat.</p>

<h3 id="certbot">Certbot</h3>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get started. Clone the repository into <code>/opt/letsencrypt</code> for further usage.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/certbot/certbot /opt/letsencrypt
</code></pre>

<h3 id="generating-the-certificate">Generating the certificate</h3>

<p>Make sure that there is nothing listening on ports: 80, 443. To list usage:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">netstat -nlt | grep ':80\s'
netstat -nlt | grep ':443\s'
</code></pre>

<p>Kill everything that might be on these ports, like apache2 and httpd. These will be used by haproxy and certbot for challenges
and redirecting traffic.</p>

<p>You will be creating a <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#standalone">standalone</a> certificate. This is the reason we need port 80 and 443 open.
Run certbot by defining the <code>certonly</code> and <code>--standalone</code> flags. For domain validation you are going to use port 443, tls-sni-01 challenge.
The whole command looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">cd /opt/letsencrypt
./certbot-auto certonly --standalon -d example.com -d www.example.com
</code></pre>

<p>If this displays something like, &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t connect&rdquo; you probably still have something running on a port it tries to use. The
generated certificate will be located under <code>/etc/letsencrypt/archive</code> and <code>/etc/letsencrypt/keys</code> while <code>/etc/letsencrypt/live</code> is
a symlink to the latest version of the cert. It&rsquo;s wise to not copy these away from here, since the live link is always updated to the latest version.
Our script will handle haproxy, which requires one cert file made from privkey + fullchain|.pem files.</p>

<h3 id="setup-auto-renewal">Setup Auto-Renewal</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s Encrypt issues short lived certificates (90 days). In order to not have to do this procedure every 89 days, certbot provides a nifty
command called <code>renew</code>. However, for the cert to be generated, the port 443 has to be open. This means, haproxy needs to be stopped before
doing the renew. Now, you COULD write a script which stops it, and after the certificate has been renewed, starts it again, but certbot has
you covered again in that department. It provides hooks called <code>pre-hook</code> and <code>post-hook</code>. Thus, all you have to write is the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#!/bin/bash

cd /opt/letsencrypt
./certbot-auto renew --pre-hook &quot;service haproxy stop&quot; --post-hook &quot;service haproxy start&quot;
DOMAIN='example.com' sudo -E bash -c 'cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/privkey.pem &gt; /etc/haproxy/certs/$DOMAIN.pem'
</code></pre>

<p>If you would like to test it first, just include the switch <code>--dry-run</code>.</p>

<p>In case of success you should see something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">root@raspberrypi:/opt/letsencrypt# ./certbot-auto renew --pre-hook &quot;service haproxy stop&quot; --post-hook &quot;service haproxy start&quot; --dry-run
Saving debug log to /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log

** DRY RUN: simulating 'certbot renew' close to cert expiry
**          (The test certificates below have not been saved.)

Congratulations, all renewals succeeded. The following certs have been renewed:
  /etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com/fullchain.pem (success)
** DRY RUN: simulating 'certbot renew' close to cert expiry
**          (The test certificates above have not been saved.)
Running post-hook command: service haproxy start
</code></pre>

<p>Put this script into a crontab to run every 89 days like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">crontab -e
# Open crontab for edit and paste in this line
* * */89 * * /root/renew-cert.sh
</code></pre>

<p>And you should be all set. Now we move on the configure haproxy to redirect and to use our newly generated certificate.</p>

<h2 id="haproxy-1">Haproxy</h2>

<p>Like I said, haproxy requires a single file certificate in order to encrypt traffic to and from the website. To do this, we need to combine
<code>privkey.pem</code> and <code>fullchain.pem</code>. As of this writing, there are a couple of solutions to automate this via a post hook on renewal. And also,
there is an open ticket with certbot to implement a simpler solution located here: <a href="https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/1201">https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/1201</a>. I, for now,
have chosen to simply concatenate the two files together with <code>cat</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">DOMAIN='example.com' sudo -E bash -c 'cat /etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/fullchain.pem /etc/letsencrypt/live/$DOMAIN/privkey.pem &gt; /etc/haproxy/certs/$DOMAIN.pem'
</code></pre>

<p>It will create a combined cert under <code>/etc/haproxy/certs/example.com.pem</code>.</p>

<h3 id="haproxy-configuration">Haproxy configuration</h3>

<p>If haproxy happens to be running, stop it with <code>service haproxy stop</code>.</p>

<p>First, save the default configuration file: <code>cp /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg.old</code>. Now, overwrite the old one with this
new one (comments about what each setting does, are in-lined; they are safe to copy):</p>

<p>Save this, and start haproxy with <code>services haproxy start</code>. If you did everything right, it should say nothing.
If, however, there went something wrong with starting the proxy, it usually displays something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">Job for haproxy.service failed. See 'systemctl status haproxy.service' and 'journalctl -xn' for details.
</code></pre>

<p>You can also gather some more information on what went wrong from <code>less /var/log/haproxy.log</code>.</p>

<h1 id="starting-the-server">Starting the Server</h1>

<p>Everything should be ready to go. Hugo has the concept of a baseUrl. Everything that it loads, and tries to access
will be prefixed with it. You can either set it through it&rsquo;s <code>config.yaml</code> file, or from the command line.</p>

<p>To start the server, call this from the site&rsquo;s root folder:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">hugo server --bind=192.168.x.x --port=8080 --baseUrl=https://example.com --appendPort=false
</code></pre>

<p>Interesting thing here to note is <code>https</code> and the port. The IP could be 127.0.0.1 as well. I experienced problems though
with not binding to network IP when I was debugging the site from a different laptop on the same network.</p>

<p>Once the server is started, you should be able to open up your website from a different browser, not on your local network,
and see that it has a valid certificate installed. In Chrome you should see a green icon telling you that the cert is valid.</p>

<h1 id="last-words">Last Words</h1>

<p>And that is all. The site should be up and running and the proxy should auto-renew your site&rsquo;s certificate. If you happened to
change DNS or change the server, you&rsquo;ll have to reissue the certificate.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!
Any questions or trouble setting something up, please feel free to leave a comment.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Gergely.</p>

<p>Hi Folks.</p>

<p>This is a follow up on my previous post about Google Sign-In. In this post we will discover what to do with the information retrieved in the first encounter, which you can find here: <a href="http://skarlso.github.io/2016/06/12/google-signin-with-go/">Google Sign-In Part 1</a>.</p>

<h1 id="forewords">Forewords</h1>

<h2 id="the-project">The Project</h2>

<p>Everything I did in the first post, and that I&rsquo;m going to do in this example, can be found in this project: <a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/google-oauth-go-sample">Google-OAuth-Go-Sample</a>.</p>

<p>Just to recap, we left off previously on the point where we successfully obtained information about the user, with a secure token and a session initiated with them. Google nicely enough provided us with some details which we can use. This information was in JSON format and looked something like this:</p>

<p>In my example, to keep things simple, I will use the email address since that has to be unique in the land of Google. You could assign an ID to the user, and you could complicate things even further, but my goal is not to write an academic paper about cryptography here.</p>

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>

<h2 id="making-something-useful-out-of-the-data">Making something useful out of the data</h2>

<p>In order for the app to recognise a user it must save some data about the user. I&rsquo;m doing that in MongoDB right now, but that could be any form of persistence layer, like, SQLite3, BoltDB, PostgresDB, etc.</p>

<h3 id="after-successful-user-authorization">After successful user authorization</h3>

<p>Once the user used google to provide us with sufficient information about him/herself, we can retrieve data about that user from our records. The data could be anything that is linked to our unique identifier like: Character Profile, Player Information, Status, Last Logged-In, etcetc. For this, there are two things that need to happen after authorization: Save/Load user information and initiate a session.</p>

<p>The session can be in the form of a cookie, or a Redis storage, or URL re-writing. I&rsquo;m choosing a cookie here.</p>

<h3 id="save-load-user-information">Save / Load user information</h3>

<p>All I&rsquo;m doing is a simple, <em>returning / new</em> user handling. The concept is simple. If the email isn&rsquo;t saved, we save it. If it&rsquo;s saved, we set a logic to our page render to greet the returning user.</p>

<p>In the <code>AuthHandler</code> I&rsquo;m doing the following:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">...
seen := false
db := database.MongoDBConnection{}
if _, mongoErr := db.LoadUser(u.Email); mongoErr == nil {
    seen = true
} else {
    err = db.SaveUser(&amp;u)
    if err != nil {
        log.Println(err)
        c.HTML(http.StatusBadRequest, &quot;error.tmpl&quot;, gin.H{&quot;message&quot;: &quot;Error while saving user. Please try again.&quot;})
        return
    }
}
c.HTML(http.StatusOK, &quot;battle.tmpl&quot;, gin.H{&quot;email&quot;: u.Email, &quot;seen&quot;: seen})
...
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s break this down a bit. There is a db connection here, which calls a function that either returns an error, or it doesn&rsquo;t. If it doesn&rsquo;t, that means we have our user. If it does, it means we have to save the user. This is a very simple case (disregard for now, that the error could be something else as well (If you can&rsquo;t get passed that, you could type check the error or check if the returned record contains the requested user information instead of checking for an error.)).</p>

<p>The template is than rendered depending on the <code>seen</code> boolean like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot;
      type=&quot;image/png&quot;
      href=&quot;/img/favicon.ico&quot; /&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/css/main.css&quot;&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    {{if .seen}}
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome back to the battlefield '{{ .email }}'.&lt;/h1&gt;
    {{else}}
        &lt;h1&gt;Welcome to the battlefield '{{ .email }}'.&lt;/h1&gt;
    {{end}}
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>You can see here, that if <code>seen</code> is <em>true</em> the header message will say: &ldquo;Welcome <em>back</em>&hellip;&ldquo;.</p>

<h3 id="initiating-a-session">Initiating a session</h3>

<p>When the user is successfully authenticated, we activate a session so that the user can access pages that require authorization. Here, I have to mention that I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin">Gin</a>, so restricted end-points are made with groups which require a middleware.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, I&rsquo;m using cookies as session handlers. For this, a new session store has to be created with some secure token. This is achieved with the following code fragments ( note that I&rsquo;m using a Gin session middleware which uses gorilla&rsquo;s session handler located here: <a href="https://github.com/gin-gonic/contrib">Gin-Gonic(Sessions)</a>):</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// RandToken in handlers.go:
// RandToken generates a random @l length token.
func RandToken(l int) string {
	b := make([]byte, l)
	rand.Read(b)
	return base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(b)
}

// quest.go:
// Create the cookie store in main.go.
store := sessions.NewCookieStore([]byte(handlers.RandToken(64)))
store.Options(sessions.Options{
    Path:   &quot;/&quot;,
    MaxAge: 86400 * 7,
})

// using the cookie store:
router.Use(sessions.Sessions(&quot;goquestsession&quot;, store))
</code></pre>

<p>After this <code>gin.Context</code> lets us access this session store by doing <code>session := sessions.Default(c)</code>. Now, create a session variable called <code>user-id</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">session.Set(&quot;user-id&quot;, u.Email)
err = session.Save()
if err != nil {
    log.Println(err)
    c.HTML(http.StatusBadRequest, &quot;error.tmpl&quot;, gin.H{&quot;message&quot;: &quot;Error while saving session. Please try again.&quot;})
    return
}
</code></pre>

<p>Don&rsquo;t forget to <code>save</code> the session. ;) That is it. If I restart the server, the cookie won&rsquo;t be usable any longer, since it will generate a new token for the cookie store. The user will have to log in again. <strong>Note</strong>: It might be that you&rsquo;ll see something like this, from <code>session</code>: <code>[sessions] ERROR! securecookie: the value is not valid</code>. You can ignore this error.</p>

<h2 id="restricting-access-to-certain-end-points-with-the-auth-middleware">Restricting access to certain end-points with the auth Middleware™</h2>

<p>Now, that our session is alive, we can use it to restrict access to some part of the application. With Gin, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">authorized := router.Group(&quot;/battle&quot;)
authorized.Use(middleware.AuthorizeRequest())
{
    authorized.GET(&quot;/field&quot;, handlers.FieldHandler)
}
</code></pre>

<p>This creates a grouping of end-points under <code>/battle</code>. Which means, everything under <code>/battle</code> will only be accessible if the middleware passed to the <code>Use</code> function calls the next handler in the chain. If it aborts the call chain, the end-point will not be accessible. My middleware is pretty simple, but it gets the job done:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// AuthorizeRequest is used to authorize a request for a certain end-point group.
func AuthorizeRequest() gin.HandlerFunc {
	return func(c *gin.Context) {
		session := sessions.Default(c)
		v := session.Get(&quot;user-id&quot;)
		if v == nil {
			c.HTML(http.StatusUnauthorized, &quot;error.tmpl&quot;, gin.H{&quot;message&quot;: &quot;Please log in.&quot;})
			c.Abort()
		}
		c.Next()
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note, that this only check if <code>user-id</code> is set or not. That&rsquo;s certainly not enough for a secure application. Its only supposed to be a simple example of the mechanics of the auth middleware. Also, the session usually contains more than one parameter. It&rsquo;s more likely that it contains several variables, which describe the user including a state for CORS protection. For CORS I&rsquo;d recommend using <a href="https://github.com/rs/cors">rs/cors</a>.</p>

<p>If you would try to access <a href="http://127.0.0.1:9090/battle/field">http://127.0.0.1:9090/battle/field</a> without logging in, you&rsquo;d be redirected to an <code>error.tmpl</code> with the message: <strong>Please log in.</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="final-words">Final Words</h1>

<p>That&rsquo;s pretty much it. Important parts are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Saving the right information</li>
<li>Secure cookie store</li>
<li>CORS for sessions</li>
<li>Checks of the users details in the cookie</li>
<li>Authorised end-points</li>
<li>Session handling</li>
</ul>

<p>Any questions, remarks, ideas, are very welcomed in the comment section. There are plenty of very nice Go frameworks which do Google OAuth2 out of the box. I recommend using them, as they save you a lot of legwork.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hey folks.</p>

<p>So, there is this project called <a href="https://github.com/cantino/huginn">Huginn</a> which I absolutely love.</p>

<p>But the thing is, that for a couple of scrappers ( at least for me ), I don&rsquo;t want to spin up a whole rails app.</p>

<p>Hence, I&rsquo;ve come up with <a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/rscrap">RScrap</a>. Which is a bunch of Ruby scripts run as cron jobs on a raspberry pi. And because I dislike emails as well, and most of the time, I don&rsquo;t read them, I opted for a nicer solution. Enter the world of <a href="https://telegram.org">Telegram</a>. They provide you with the ability to create bots. You basically get an API key, and than using that key, you can send private messages, or even create an interactive bot which you can send messages too.</p>

<p>In my simple example, I&rsquo;m using it to send private messages to myself, but I could just as well, make it interactive and than tell it to run one of the scripts.</p>

<h1 id="the-code">The Code</h1>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at what we got.</p>

<h2 id="the-main-scraper">The main scraper</h2>

<p>The main scraper, is simply bunch of convenience methods that wrap handling and working with the database and the telegram bot. That&rsquo;s all. It&rsquo;s very simple. Very short. The Telegram part is just this bit:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def send_message(text)
  Telegram::Bot::Client.run(@token) do |bot|
    bot.api.send_message(chat_id: @id, text: text)
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Straightforward. Creating an interactive bot, would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require 'telegram/bot'

token = 'YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_API_TOKEN'

Telegram::Bot::Client.run(token) do |bot|
  bot.listen do |message|
    case message.text
    when '/start'
      bot.api.send_message(chat_id: message.chat.id, text: &quot;Hello, #{message.from.first_name}&quot;)
    when '/stop'
      bot.api.send_message(chat_id: message.chat.id, text: &quot;Bye, #{message.from.first_name}&quot;)
    end
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, it will listen, and than you can send it messages and based on the parsed <code>message.text</code> you can define functions to call. For example, for rscrap I could define something like <code>run_script(script)</code>. And the command would be: <code>/run reddit</code>. Which will execute my reddit script. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<h2 id="the-scripts">The scripts</h2>

<p>The scripts use nokogiri to parse a web page, and than return a URL which will be sent by the TelegramBot. They are also saved in the database so that when a new comic strip comes out, I know that it&rsquo;s new. For reddit, I&rsquo;m saving a timestamp as well, and I collect everything after that timestamp through the reddit API as JSON, and send it as a bundled message with shortified links to the posts using bit.ly.</p>

<p>The scraping is most of the times the same for every comic. Thus, there is a helper method for it. The script itself, is very short. For example, lets look at gunnerkrigg court.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">require_relative '../rscrap'
require 'nokogiri'
require 'open-uri'

url = 'http://www.gunnerkrigg.com'
scrap = Rscrap.new
page = Nokogiri::HTML(open(url))
comic_id = page.css('img.comic_image')[0].select { |e| e if e[0] == 'src' }[0][1]
new_comic = &quot;#{url}#{comic_id}&quot;
scrap.send_new_comic(url, new_comic)
</code></pre>

<p>The interesting part of it is this bit: <code>comic_id = page.css('img.comic_image')[0].select { |e| e if e[0] == 'src' }[0][1]</code>. It extracts the URL for the comic image, and stores it as an &ldquo;id&rdquo; of the comic. This than, is sent as a message which Telegram will embed. There is no need to visit the web page, the image is in your feed and you can view it directly. Just like an RSS ready.</p>

<h2 id="cron">Cron</h2>

<p>These scripts are best used in a cron job. The comics are usually running with a daily frequency, where as the reddit gatherer is running with an hour frequency. Basically, I&rsquo;m receiving updates on an hourly basis if there are new posts by then. Running ruby from cron was a bit tricky. I&rsquo;m using bundler for the environment, and came up with this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">0 6-23 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/&lt;youruser&gt;/rubyproj/rscrap &amp;&amp; bundle exec ruby scripts/reddit.rb'
0 8,22 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/&lt;youruser&gt;/rubyproj/rscrap &amp;&amp; bundle exec ruby scripts/gunnerkrigg.rb'
0 8,22 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/&lt;youruser&gt;/rubyproj/rscrap &amp;&amp; bundle exec ruby scripts/aws_blog.rb'
0 5,23 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/&lt;youruser&gt;/rubyproj/rscrap &amp;&amp; bundle exec ruby scripts/goblinscomic.rb'
0 6,20 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/&lt;youruser&gt;/rubyproj/rscrap &amp;&amp; bundle exec ruby scripts/xkcd.rb'
0 7,19 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/&lt;youruser&gt;/rubyproj/rscrap &amp;&amp; bundle exec ruby scripts/commitstrip.rb'
0 8 * * * /bin/bash -l -c 'cd /home/&lt;youruser&gt;/rubyproj/rscrap &amp;&amp; bundle exec ruby scripts/sequiential_art.rb'
</code></pre>

<p>And a telegram message for all these things, looks like this:
Reddit:
<img src="https://github.com/Skarlso/rscrap/raw/master/shorten.png" alt="TelegramIMReddit" />
Comics:
<img src="https://github.com/Skarlso/rscrap/raw/master/rscrap2.png" alt="TelegramIMComics" /></p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>That&rsquo;s it folks. Adding a new scraper is easy. I added the aws blog as a new entry as well by just copying the comics scripts. And I&rsquo;m also getting Weather Reports delivered every morning to me.</p>

<p>Have fun. Any questions, please feel free to leave a comment!</p>

<p>Thanks,
Gergely.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>Today, I would like to tell you about my configuration for a low budget Home Theater setup.</p>

<p>My tools are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://flirc.tv/">FLIRC</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/">Raspberry Pi 2</a></li>
<li>500G SSD</li>
<li>An a good &lsquo;ol wifi</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h2>

<p>Use Flirc for remote control, <code>omxplayer</code> for streaming the movie from an SSD on a headless PI controller via SSH and enjoy a nice, cold Lemon - Menta beer.</p>

<h2 id="flirc">Flirc</h2>

<p>First, the remote control. So, I like to sit in my couch and watch the movie from there. I hate getting up, or having a keyboard at arm length to control the pi. Flirc is a very easy way of doing just that with a simple remote control.</p>

<p>It costs ~$22 and is easy to setup. Works with any kind of remote control. Setting up key bindings for the control, is as simple as starting the Flirc software and pressing buttons on the remote to map to keyboard keys. Now, my pi is running headless, and the Flirc binary isn&rsquo;t quite working with raspbian; so to do the binding, I just did that on my main machine. When I was done, I just plugged in the Flirc, and proceeded to setup the pi.</p>

<h2 id="raspberry-pi-2">Raspberry Pi 2</h2>

<p>The pi 2 is a small powerhouse. However, the SD card on which it sits is simply not fast enough. From time to time, I experienced lateness in sound, or stutter in video. So, instead of having the movie on the pi, I&rsquo;m streaming through a faster SSD with <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs">SSHFS</a>. For playing, I&rsquo;m using <code>omxplayer</code>. With omxplayer, I had a few problems, because sound was not coming through the HDMI cable. A little bit of research lead me to this change in the pi&rsquo;s boot config. Uncomment this line:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#hdmi_driver=2
</code></pre>

<p>After rebooting, I also, did this thing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">sudo apt-get install alsa-utils
sudo modprobe snd_bcm2835
sudo amixer -c 0 cset numid=3 2
</code></pre>

<p>This saved my bacon. The whole answer can be found here: <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/44/why-is-my-audio-sound-output-not-working">Stackoverflow</a>.</p>

<p>Once SSHFS was working, and HDMI received sound, I just executed this command: <code>omxplayer -o hdmi /media/stream/my_movie.mkv</code>. This told omxplayer to use the local HDMI connection for video output.</p>

<p>All this was from my computer through an SSH session so I never controlled the pi directly. Once done, I proceeded to sit down with a nice, cold Lemon - Menta beer and a remote control.</p>

<p>Once little gotcha &ndash; <code>omxplayer</code> is controlled through the buttons + (volume up), - (volume down), <SPACE> (stop, play), and q for quitting. Flirc is able to map any key <em>combinations</em> on a keyboard as well to any button on the remote. Combinations can be done by selecting a control key and pressing another key. So mapping <code>+</code> to the volume up button was by pressing shift and then &lsquo;=&rsquo;.</p>

<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>I enjoyed the movie while being able to adjust the volume, or pause it, when my popcorn was ready, and close the player when the movie was done. There are a number of other ways to do this, like using <a href="https://kodi.tv/">kodi</a> + <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.leetzone.android.yatsewidgetfree&amp;hl=en">yatse</a>. Which lets you remote control a media software with your mobile phone. But I&rsquo;m using the pi for a number of other things and the GUI is rather resource heavy.</p>

<p>There you have it folks. Might not be the easiest setup, but it&rsquo;s pretty awesome anyways.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Gergely.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>And than,the benchmarks of course:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">BenchmarkPigLatin-8          	  200000	     10688 ns/op
BenchmarkPigLatinStrings-8   	  100000	     15211 ns/op
PASS
</code></pre>

<p>The improvement is not massive in this case, but it&rsquo;s more than enough to matter. And in a bigger, more complicated program, string concatenation will take a LOT of time away.</p>

<p>In Go, the <code>bytes</code> package has a 1-1 map compared to the <code>strings</code> packages, so chances are, if you are doing strings concatenations you will be able to port that piece of code easily to []byte.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all folks.</p>

<p>Happy coding,
Gergely.</p>

                        <p>Quick reminder. If you have a never changing regex in Go, do NOT put it into a frequently called function. ALWAYS put it into a global variable. I&rsquo;ll show you why.</p>

<p>Benchmark for code with a variable in a frequently called function:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">BenchmarkNumber-8     	   30000	     41633 ns/op
BenchmarkAreaCode-8   	   50000	     27736 ns/op
BenchmarkFormat-8     	   50000	     29263 ns/op
PASS
ok  	_/phone-number	5.110s
</code></pre>

<p>Benchmark for code with the same variable outside in a global scope:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">BenchmarkNumber-8     	  300000	      5618 ns/op
BenchmarkAreaCode-8   	  500000	      3884 ns/op
BenchmarkFormat-8     	  300000	      4696 ns/op
PASS
ok  	_/phone-number	5.197s

<p>Notice the magnitude change in ns/op! That&rsquo;s something to keep an eye out for.</p>

                        <p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Quick gotcha, when working with Drupal. If you just freshly installed it, and everything seems to work fine, and yet you are experiencing things like, the admin toolbar is randomly disappearing, or configuration is not saved; than you might not have modrewrite enabled on your apache server.</p>

<p>Because, by default, Drupal has clean url enabled, that needs URL rewriting on apache.</p>

<p>So, step one.</p>

<p>Have this in your .htaccess file:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
  RewriteEngine on
  ... # and than a bunch of rewrite rules according to your leisure
</code></pre>

<p>Than look up this line in your httpd.conf file and remove the prefix &lsquo;#&rsquo;.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">#LoadModule rewrite_module libexec/apache2/mod_rewrite.so
</code></pre>

<p>That is all. From there on, everything should work. If, you don&rsquo;t want the clean url setting, yet you can&rsquo;t disable it, and don&rsquo;t want to restart the server and edit the settings.php file; use drush like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">drush vset clean_url 0 --yes
</code></pre>

<p>This should disable it and bust the cache in the process so it&rsquo;s immediately visible.</p>

<p>That is all folks.</p>

<p>Cheers,
Gergely.</p>

                        <p>Though it could be done better, I&rsquo;m sure, but I&rsquo;m actually pretty satisfied with this one. It loops only twice as opposed to filtered ranges and whatnot other solutions to the sieve. I was thinking of rather creating a list and deleting elements from it, but that&rsquo;s already three loops.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll do a benchmark later on more solutions.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby"># Sieve contains a function to return a set of primes

  # Returns a list of primes up to a certain limit
  # @param n limit

    marked = []
    primes = []
