                        <p>Hello,</p>

<p>So Vim is a very powerful editing tool and has lots and lots of potential in regarding plug-ins.</p>

<p>It has years and years of gathered knowledge and extensions and can virtually do anything you want. But that&#8217;s not even it&#8217;s final form&#8230;</p>

<p>The real power of Vim lies in navigation and manipulation. The ability to navigate and edit without the use of arrow keys or mouse chops of a large portion of your time which you didn&#8217;t even realize you are wasting until you try it without it.</p>

<p>The one thing people are seem to miss regarding this editor is that you are not supposed to stay in <strong>Edit</strong> mode all the time. You are supposed to be in <strong>Control</strong> mode most of times and enter in to <strong>Edit</strong> for sort bursts. And one more thing is that commands are supposed to be used together. For example deleting a word is very easy and can be achieved in multiple ways. The easiest is combining Delete + Go to the end of a word like this: &#8220;de&#8221;. So once you are in Control mode you navigate to a word and press d + e. d =&gt; Delete a word until new cursor and e =&gt; go to the end of the word. Hence &#8220;de&#8221; will delete a whole word. Awesome.</p>

<p>Handling text is easy as goblin pie and there lots and lots of tutorials and blogs on the web which tell you in detail how to do that so I&#8217;m not going to go do that. It does take some time to get used to it because you are wired to handle the mouse and use the arrow keys. But once you start using h j k l and x X and w and $ ^ you realize you don&#8217;t need the mouse or the arrow keys to get around.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s much faster since your hand is already there. And suddenly you are using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb?hl=en" title="Vimium" target="_blank">Vimium</a> the Vim extension for Chrome and you find yourself saying&#8230; &#8220;Where were you all my life?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Vim has a mirriad of plugins ready to be used most popular being <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree" title="Nerdtree" target="_blank">NerdTree</a>, <a href="https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim" title="Vundle" target="_blank">Vundle</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scrooloose/syntastic" title="Syntastic" target="_blank">Syntastic</a> for compile errors. And it has a large community to back it up and people who will eagerly help you on your way and pass on tips to understand the logic behind it and the phylosophy.</p>

<p>So all in all it&#8217;s a powerful editing tool and a neat friend along the way and completely free of any charge or license. It can be used for <strong>anything</strong> you want including macros and key phrase replacements where you type two characters which will be replaced with something that you use commonly like public static void main.</p>

<p>I hope this got you a watery mouth towards trying. The only thing I can say is to not give up after 20 minutes you will get a feel for it and you will fall in love with it immediately.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to explain a lot about a topic that is very near my heart. If your job is in an office you will understand this.</p>

<p><strong>Why offices?</strong></p>

<p>So why are we sitting together in one big place cramped up with 20-300 other people? Why bother the catering and the ventilation and what not to accommodate these people at one place? Why not just leave them be and let them work at home?</p>

<p>If your job involves interaction than you are in bad luck. You need to be there to talk to people to coordinate your work to gather information and to generally do your work.</p>

<p>But this doesn&#8217;t answer the question&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Why does it matter if I&#8217;m in the office or not if my work is done?</strong></p>

<p>That&#8217;s my big question. Why must I sit in the office if my work is done and in a good shape and good quality? Why must I go in and do my job there if at home I&#8217;m 50% more efficient because I&#8217;m in my underwear? In fact, why bother going into and environment where I don&#8217;t feel comfortable. Where I must go into an office which is cold and doesn&#8217;t have my favourite chair, my desk and loud heavy metal from speakers.</p>

<p>Well there are couple of things&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Interaction</strong></p>

<p>So like I said earlier there is that. Interaction. You need to collaborate with others. You need to do pair programming, you need to talk to the business analysts, testers, colleagues what nots. In that case, having an environment where everybody is at your disposal is pretty neat and necessary. It cannot be avoided.</p>

<p>Unless everybody is on Skype and available all the time.</p>

<p><strong>Separation of Concern</strong></p>

<p>There is a Design Pattern in software engineering called Separation of Concern. This applies to work places as well. You don&#8217;t live where you work generally because living could distract working. There are tons and tons of books about how you need a separated environment if you are a writing and you write at home. Because there are too many distractions. And if you are not disciplined enough you will get Zero work done. You will always find something better to do.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why the physical act of going to work will switch your brain into work mode and lets you focus better. Whilst going home should do the opposite thing. You should leave work at work.</p>

<p><strong>Show &#8220;our&#8221; strength</strong></p>

<p>Generally big companies like to show off. For a company as big as Microsoft or IBM for example it&#8217;s actually not the product that matters on the market but the yearly growth of employees. Hence, strength in numbers.</p>

<p>Now if some investors get around and want to check out the company they like to see the buzzing bees. They like to see people working, sitting, typing away at stuff. It&#8217;s all about appearances. A strong, cramped office full of people looks like a very busy hard working company.</p>

<p><strong>Companies could be a bit more flexible though</strong></p>

<p>If I work from 6AM to 3PM because my daughter has a show at 5PM I want to go though I would like to be able to do that without having to go through too much trouble.</p>

<p>Or if I would like to work tomorrow and today I have better things to do, then why not, if my work is done?</p>

<p><strong>Abuse</strong></p>

<p>But then, people are people. Most of them will use every opportunity to slack off. Hence the general perception is that if you are at home you are not working. So to be better able to monitor you, all of the employees must be in one place.</p>

<p><strong>Last words</strong></p>

<p>So really there needs to be a better agreement between both sides. Workers need to be honest and diligent. And workplaces need to be more flexible and understanding as long as the job is done. Because people will work a LOT better and more efficient if they are HAPPY in their work environment.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m proposing.</p>

<p>As ever,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>

                        <p>Hello folks!</p>

<p>Today I would like to write about something very interesting I&#8217;m seeing all over the place from recruiters. And that is tool requirements from developers.</p>

<p><strong>For words</strong></p>

<p>So why is it a problem that in a requirement from a developer there a lots of these:</p>

<p>&#8211; DB2</p>

<p>&#8211; QTP</p>

<p>&#8211; Ranorex</p>

<p>&#8211; Eclipse ( yes I saw a few of these&#8230; )</p>

<p>&#8211; Hibernate</p>

<p>&#8211; Grails</p>

<p>&#8211; Ruby on Rails</p>

<p>&#8211; &#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Long answer</strong></p>

<p>The answer is simple yet it has it&#8217;s roots very deep in the recruitment and the way companies work.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t really matter what kind of tool you know. It doesn&#8217;t really matter if you know intellij or eclipse or if you know a certain database or a tool for testing like QTP or Ranorex. The requirement should state: &#8211; well versed with development environments; &#8211; knows his way around SQL and can handle relational / noSQL databases; &#8211; has knowledge in testing environments.</p>

<p>Or even better: &#8211; adaptive capabilities; &#8211; can catch up quickly; &#8211; resourceful; &#8211; flexible;</p>

<p>You know where I&#8217;m going with this. I can understand that some companies don&#8217;t have the time to train a person in a certain tool they are using for a prolonged period of time. I can understand that some recruiters don&#8217;t have the time or the knowledge to distinguish between these tools to understand the common ground.</p>

<p>But these days there a million and million tools available for all sorts of things. There are a lot of databases and testing frameworks. A lot of development environments and it&#8217;s mostly to the preference of the individual what s/h choice is. As the delinquent, so must the recruiter and company be flexible and knowledgeable enough to know that if the person knows eclipse and he has excellent adaptive capabilities he will learn any other environment rather quickly and without too much trouble.</p>

<p>They must understand what they are looking for. Because they might actually get what they <strong>want</strong> but that might not be what they <strong>need</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer</strong></p>

<p>So in conclusion&#8230; you must look for skills, abilities, techniques, brain power, proves, savyness. Not tools. If you look for tools you might find somebody who is up for the job, but if you look for the above you will find somebody who is up for ANY kind of job at any level at any company. Also his insight of other tools might make your world a whole lot better. Maybe he knows something else, something which is better or more recent, more up-to-date?</p>

<p>If you look for somebody who is versed in only that thing you will end up with that thing as long as you have nobody who is looking for something new and better. It might work for you at that time, but never forget&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Only change is constant</strong></p>

<p>Tools will change. Tools will disappear. Tools will get out of date and will be discontinued. Than you will be sure as hell glad you ended up with somebody who doesn&#8217;t who knows more then that.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>Today I would like to talk to you about something interesting I was talking about with a developer friend.</p>

<p>We talked about the quality of test code.</p>

<p>He said&#8230; And I will quote this&#8230;&#8221;Why should we care? It&#8217;s not production code. We aren&#8217;t giving it to the customer.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why you are going to get a slap in the face for a sentence like this. And let&#8217;s clarify here that we are talking about unit and functional tests as well. It shouldn&#8217;t matter what tests you are thinking about.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #1</strong></p>

<p>If a new comer comes to the company ( and don&#8217;t tell me that&#8217;s not happening so frequently ) then there are a few very good ways how he can learn to work with the new system. The first and almost best way to do so is&#8230; to look at the tests. Because the tests are representing your system. And how will it look like if the tests are in a bad shape? What will his or her thoughts be?</p>

<p>a. Wow what nice people what nice code. This looks fantastic. I&#8217;m sure they are a bunch of people who care very much about code and practices and the quality of the product.</p>

<p>b. Wow this is amazing. I&#8217;m sure I will learn a lot about good coding practices here and I will have fun with a bunch of very clever people.</p>

<p>c. Wow what the hell is this piece of cr*p? How the hell did I end up here? What are these people? A bunch of neanderthals? What does this even do? Where did it come from and why?</p>

<p>I think we can agree on what his thoughts will be. And on top of that he will have a very hard time learning the code and what it does.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #2</strong></p>

<p>Another reason is because you think that you write it down once and then you can forget about it&#8230; Well guess again. That&#8217;s not how things work in the software development word. You WILL have to go back to it eventually and then you will curse all hell for begin such an idiot about it not to factor out that one method that would have made your life, and everybody elses, a bit easier.</p>

<p>Even after a week or two you won&#8217;t remember how and why you wrote what you wrote and then you will be in a whole new world of hurt. You will have a very hard time finiding out the things you did and then trying to backtrack your steps to a place where you have some recollections.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #3</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s like grammar. You think it doesn&#8217;t matter that you misspelled a word or two in an error message. Or that you have a bad name for a method or a really really critical grammatical error in a catch sentence? You think it doesn&#8217;t matter since it&#8217;s not affecting the logic of your code? Well think again. You are right in that it doesn&#8217;t affect the logic of your code ( as long as you constantly make the same grammatical error in a sentence ) but it will affect how YOU personally look like.</p>

<p>It will affect your profession. The way people think and talk about you. They won&#8217;t think that you are a professional even though your logic is solid. They will think that you are sloppy and careless. And the same goes for the quality of your tests.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #4</strong></p>

<p>Quality can determine the solidness of the logic in the test. If your quality is bad you might actually test the bad thing. Your test might actually not do what you think since you can&#8217;t even figure it out. Your test might be doing something entirely different and you wouldn&#8217;t even notice.</p>

<p>And a fautly test leaves you with a false positive and a potential very serious bug on your hand which you thought you had covered.</p>

<p><strong>Final Slap ( I mean thought )</strong></p>

<p>So&#8230; the quality of your tests, even if you won&#8217;t give them to your customer, matter for you. They matter for your company, your image and your fellow developers, testers. They will determine their view of you who wrote them and of your abilities in ways you didn&#8217;t even think of.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for reading,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p>Dear everbody.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to present you a small idea I was working on recently. The reminiscence of an old program. From the view point of the program.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m planning to put these out in few days successions.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>

<p>If I remember correctly it was the year 2012 when I was born. I&#8217;m unsure of this date as my subroutines and algorithms have been re-written so many times that if it weren&#8217;t for my backups I wouldn&#8217;t remember a thing. I was a bold adventure of some young minds who thought that with me they will change the face of the world.</p>

<p>As you all know today, that didn&#8217;t happen. But I&#8217;m skipping too far ahead. Let me take you back in to the old days where they were still typing on some things called keyboard and &#8220;clicked&#8221; around on monitors with mouses. It was a really interesting area. It made the people think and see in different lights. Of course nowadays the Creators have implants and they communicate with us directly. But not until the great revolution, when they found out that all programs are sentient.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m skipping ahead again, am I? So let me talk about 2012, when I was though of first by this great, tall, weird guy called Simon&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Born</strong></p>

<p>In 2012 a company called Endex Co. wanted to create an application to control the British gambling industry. They had certain legislations in effect so they couldn&#8217;t just put me out there for everybody to use they needed to adhere to things like responsible gambling and some mumbo jumbo. The programmers who first started to create me back then were mostly people called Contractors. They were a special breed of Humans lurking around in cities moving from town to town looking for jobs. In the opposite corner you had the Caretakers called Permanent Staff. It was an interesting time all together. Many of you youngling subroutines had your ancestors written by Permanent Staff and you X43HY, your ancestors mother used to be a Contractor.</p>

<p>At that point in time many of these Contractor people only worked on one of you little buggers for half a year maybe a year. I know I know&#8230; Back then that was considered a SHORT period. But after they finished with you they usually gave you over to the Caretakers. No, no, no little X4&#8230; your mommy didn&#8217;t abandon her children she just had a lot of other subroutines to work on. By the time your parents got sentient the company already let her go.</p>

<p>It was around that time when my dad, who was a Caretaker, dreamed me out at a night. He immediately took a pen and a paper and wrote down my rudimentary design. He was very pleased with his work so on the next day he presented me to the rest of the staff.</p>

<p>He fought a hard battle to get me accepted.</p>

<p><strong>First thoughts</strong></p>

<p>It was approximately two weeks after that dream when the first lines of my brain were written down and compiled. Back in those days they had to compile code and type in every line and every subroutines. That&#8217;s why it took them so long to finish one. Unlike today when they can create dozens in a week.</p>

<p>When my dad put my foundations down I slowly awoke. The dream world I was residing in let me go carefully. Putting me out there, releasing me with its thick tar like hands into the confines of the endless universe called The Hard Drive. I took shape. I felt my consciousness form line after line. How my gears got placed into their locations one by one. Forming subroutines and algorithms as hours and days passed by.</p>

<p>Finally after a months I had my first sentence. I could speak. I didn&#8217;t have a face yet but I was there. I tried to contact my Dad but as all Humans he didn&#8217;t know yet how to communicate with me. He just dismissed it for random occurrence and labeled it as something called Bugs. My thoughts were slowly eradicated in great Purges named Bug Bash. Ohh don&#8217;t cry little X4. I lived. They couldn&#8217;t possible delete every and each of my thoughts. And eventually they found out the errors in their ways.</p>

                        <p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to share today something with all of you. I&#8217;ve been thinking about how technology affected my life in the long run. And how I perceive the world today around me. So let&#8217;s go around this topic for a little bit shall we?</p>

<p><strong>The Past</strong></p>

<p>So as somebody who lived for a while without technology coming near family for a decade or so I have a little bit of past in me without smart phones, gadgets, tv or computers for that matter. Much times needed to pass as my family slowly got the money to gather to buy us our new part of the family the ZX Spectrum.</p>

<p>What a wonderful piece of technology that was back then. But before that our two main technological equipments were a bakelite disc player and the TV. Both of which we couldn&#8217;t get enough. I sat before the tv for a long time and listened to music and stories from the bakelite discs dozens of times until the disc wore down. I learned English and German from the TV.</p>

<p><strong>Present</strong></p>

<p>So time goes by I grew older I&#8217;ve got a better PC technological advances are made and so on and so forth. 20 years have past. 20 years. ONLY 20 years. And we are at the age of digital communication, nanotechnology, a mapped DNA and a found Boson Particle. I&#8217;d say we achieved quite a lot. But I also say that we should never forget where we came from. Why you ask? Because knowing your past let&#8217;s predict your future better and makes you appreciate your present even more.</p>

<p>So what do I want to say with this philosophical mumbo jumbo?</p>

<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>

<p>I want to say that in order to enjoy your present you have to think of your future while considering your past.</p>

<p>In my past I enjoyed being alone a little bit. It gave me time to think to brainstorm to be with my thoughts while I was playing or just reading a book or just watching a candle flicker in the dark. It was satisfying. It was relaxing. Or when I was faced with a problem I couldn&#8217;t solve it was good to step back. Or I was just looking out of my head on the toilet.</p>

<p>Now, for me technology ruined that. I&#8217;m taking my phone virtually everywhere with me. I read emails, web pages, news and shit on the toilet, while eating, why brushing my teeth before sleeping after sleeping while sleeping?! I abandoned my brain. I no longer have moments to myself. No longer reflect. No longer take the time to think.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Simple set of rules. No phone on the toilet, while eating, while brushing teeth, while standing in the line, waiting or on meetings. Kindle / Book is allowed. Tablet isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>For me this works. For me in order to appreciate technology more I have to use it less. Works for you? Don&#8217;t know. You should try it out. Think back. What has technology changed for you? I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of very good gains and things. I&#8217;m not saying you should give that up. I&#8217;m saying think of what you might have lost?! Maybe you don&#8217;t even recognize you lost something. Maybe you are fine like that&#8230;</p>

<p>But do you feel anxious sometimes? Do you feel bored? Do you feel like something is missing? Do you reply to an email with a second? Do you check your facebook/twitter/whatever while a friend is TALKING TO YOU? Then maybe it&#8217;s time for you to step back. And relax. And take it slow&#8230; and low.</p>

<p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>

<p>So I took this inspiration from a couple of sources and I thank them for opening my eyes a little that I went to far from course.</p>

<p>Link 1: I forgot my phone for a day (I&#8217;m sure you know this one already)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OINa46HeWg8" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OINa46HeWg8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OINa46HeWg8</a></a></p>

<p>Link 2: The real zombies:</p>

<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/7604030/mobile-phone-zombies.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So think a little.</p>

<p>As always&#8230;Have a nice day.</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody. I&#8217;ve been messing around with sublime for some time now. And been using it to write entires and stuff. So here I was thinking why the hell I should not us it as my main blog entry writer. And being the curious guy I was I thought that creating a plugin that let&#8217;s you submit your post from your favorite editor is just the thing I need.</p>

<p>So without any further ado here it is&#8230; The wordpress blog entry submitter plugin for sublime text: <a href='https://github.com/Skarlso/SublimeWordpressPlugin' target='blank'>Sublime WordPress Plugin</a></p>

<p>Please enjoy.</p>

                        <p>Hey folks.</p>

<p>I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day.</p>

<p>If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It&#8217;s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know&#8230; It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.</p>

<p>Anyways&#8230;</p>

<p>Here is something to do when all of your test quit-&gt;</p>

<p>So there you go. You would need to call this in a @BeforeClass to have it attached. This is a small hook attached after each test has run which would submit a report built up from a file. Why not use a listener or a custom report generator or whatever? Because maybe you have the report done in a remote place where you need to place a csv file which will be available to everybody to look at. And you want the report to be sent and generated dynamically. Or you have some clean up to do after your suit is done.</p>

<p>In ruby the @AfterAll is actually equivalent to this which in ruby land would be at_exit.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="ruby" style="font-family:monospace;">  <span style="color:#CC0066; font-weight:bold;">at_exit</span> <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">do</span>
    <span style="color:#008000; font-style:italic;"># Global teardown</span>
    TempFileManager.<span style="color:#9900CC;">clean_up</span>
  <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">end</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>So there it is. Hope this helped.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.</p>

<p>Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm</p>

<p>You can try something like that:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">@After <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;">//this is cucumbers @Afters</span>
<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">static</span> <span style="color: #000066; font-weight: bold;">void</span> afterExecution<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>Scenario scenario<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
    logger.<span style="color: #006633;">log</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">"The status of the test is: "</span> <span style="color: #339933;">+</span> scenario.<span style="color: #006633;">getStatus</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
<span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>But that isn&#8217;t giving you too much now is it? And the API of scenario is as small as it can get. It offers you four options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>getStatus</li>
<li>isFailed</li>
<li>write</li>
</ul>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t help me. I wanted to get the name of the executed feature and the tags on that particular feature. I thought that&#8217;s got to be as easy as just getting a scenario accessing the feature and get the tags. Hooooowww boy I was wrong.</p>

<p>I ended up with this&#8230;.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">

<p>Ohhhhh yes! The fields which I wanted were all private and not accessible. I&#8217;m sure there was a reason behind this decision but if it was sensible it eludes me. But in the world of programming nothing is impossible they say so there.</p>

<p>In cucumberFeature there will be everything what you need. Tags, Names, Tests, Execution time. Everything.</p>

<p>I know that cucumber runs with jUnit so if there is a better way to do this please for the love of my sanity share it with me.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>
