            Hello,
So Vim is a very powerful editing tool and has lots and lots of potential in regarding plug-ins.
It has years and years of gathered knowledge and extensions and can virtually do anything you want. But that&#8217;s not even it&#8217;s final form&#8230;
The real power of Vim lies in navigation and manipulation. The ability to navigate and edit without the use of arrow keys or mouse chops of a large portion of your time which you didn&#8217;t even realize you are wasting until you try it without it.

            Hello everybody.
I&#8217;d like to explain a lot about a topic that is very near my heart. If your job is in an office you will understand this.
Why offices?
So why are we sitting together in one big place cramped up with 20-300 other people? Why bother the catering and the ventilation and what not to accommodate these people at one place? Why not just leave them be and let them work at home?

            Hello folks!
Today I would like to write about something very interesting I&#8217;m seeing all over the place from recruiters. And that is tool requirements from developers.
For words
So why is it a problem that in a requirement from a developer there a lots of these:
&#8211; DB2
&#8211; QTP
&#8211; Ranorex
&#8211; Eclipse ( yes I saw a few of these&#8230; )
&#8211; Hibernate
&#8211; Grails
&#8211; Ruby on Rails

            Hello folks.
Today I would like to talk to you about something interesting I was talking about with a developer friend.
We talked about the quality of test code.
He said&#8230; And I will quote this&#8230;&#8221;Why should we care? It&#8217;s not production code. We aren&#8217;t giving it to the customer.&#8221;
There are a few reasons why you are going to get a slap in the face for a sentence like this.

Dear everbody.
I&#8217;d like to present you a small idea I was working on recently. The reminiscence of an old program. From the view point of the program.
I&#8217;m planning to put these out in few days successions.
I hope you enjoy it.
Cheers,
Gergely.

If I remember correctly it was the year 2012 when I was born. I&#8217;m unsure of this date as my subroutines and algorithms have been re-written so many times that if it weren&#8217;t for my backups I wouldn&#8217;t remember a thing.

            Hi folks.
I&#8217;d like to share today something with all of you. I&#8217;ve been thinking about how technology affected my life in the long run. And how I perceive the world today around me. So let&#8217;s go around this topic for a little bit shall we?
The Past
So as somebody who lived for a while without technology coming near family for a decade or so I have a little bit of past in me without smart phones, gadgets, tv or computers for that matter.

            Hello everybody. I&#8217;ve been messing around with sublime for some time now. And been using it to write entires and stuff. So here I was thinking why the hell I should not us it as my main blog entry writer. And being the curious guy I was I thought that creating a plugin that let&#8217;s you submit your post from your favorite editor is just the thing I need.
So without any further ado here it is&#8230; The wordpress blog entry submitter plugin for sublime text: Sublime WordPress Plugin

            Hey folks.
I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day.
If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It&#8217;s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know&#8230; It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.

            Hello everybody.
I would like to show you a gem today that I found out.
Apparently there is no easy way to get to the name of an executing cucumber scenario in cucumber-jvm
You can try something like that:
  @After //this is cucumbers @Afters public static void afterExecution&#40;Scenario scenario&#41; &#123; logger.log&#40;&ldquo;The status of the test is: &ldquo; + scenario.getStatus&#40;&#41;&#41;; &#125;     But that isn&#8217;t giving you too much now is it?
