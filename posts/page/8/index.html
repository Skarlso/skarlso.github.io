                        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>This time I would like to write about something that interests me. I wanted to try out a pure JavaScript web framework.</p>

<p>My choice is: <a href="https://www.meteor.com/" target="_blank">Meteor</a>. Looks interesting enough and it was recommended by a friend of mine. So, let&#8217;s dive in.</p>

<p></p>

<h4 id="installation"><strong>Installation</strong></h4>

<p>As always, one starts with installation. The page tells us to follow this simple step:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">curl https:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>install.meteor.com<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">|</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sh</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Easy enough, when you are on Linux. Turns out, that there is no official release yet for Windows. I&#8217;m in luck then. After running the command though, I saw this popping up into my face:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">curl: <span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #000000;">60</span><span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#41;</span> Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with known CA certificates
More details here: http:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>curl.haxx.se<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>docs<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>sslcerts.html</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>There is always something&#8230; in that case a more accurate command to use would be the following:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">curl <span style="color: #660033;">-k</span> https:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>install.meteor.com<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">|</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">sh</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This will force an insecure download. You might not face this issue, but just in case you do, use this command instead.</p>

<p>Branching off here. For those of you whom the curl didn&#8217;t work because you are sitting behind a proxy you can specify a &#8211;proxy  protocol//username:password@proxy:port after your curl. Of course if that doesn&#8217;t work then the script won&#8217;t work either.</p>

<p>So open the script in one of your favourite editors, for me it&#8217;s Sublime text, and find this line: &#8220;<em>Downloading Meteor distribution</em>&#8220;. Lo, and behold; it uses curl. This is the only one in the script, so just edit it by adding in your &#8211;proxy setting as before and you should be right on track.</p>

<p>If that still gives you problems, try this:</p>

<p>Assuming that your browser is set up correctly with the proxy and just command line commands aren&#8217;t working, you can go to this URL defined by the variable TARBALL_URL:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #007800;">TARBALL_URL</span>=<span style="color: #ff0000;">"https://d3sqy0vbqsdhku.cloudfront.net/packages-bootstrap/<span style="color: #007800;">${RELEASE}</span>/meteor-bootstrap-<span style="color: #007800;">${PLATFORM}</span>.tar.gz"</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Note that there are two variables in there. For me these are:</p>

<p>RELEASE: 1.0.3.1</p>

<p>PLATFORM: os.linux.x86_64</p>

<p>The full URL is:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">https:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>d3sqy0vbqsdhku.cloudfront.net<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>packages-bootstrap<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>1.0.3.1<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span>meteor-bootstrap-os.linux.x86_64.tar.gz</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Download the latest tarball and delete the CURL AND TAR command on the following line. After that, you just have to extract the tarball and move the directory to ~/.meteor.</p>

<p>Now you can run your sh again and you should be on the road, for sure this time.</p>

<p>Just to make sure, these are the line which you need to comment out:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;"># If you already have a tropohouse/warehouse, we do a clean install here:</span>

<h4 id="getting-started">Getting started</h4>

<p>After a nice installation process we can continue to the getting started phase.</p>

<p>So, the documentation tells us that we have to simply execute a command.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor create simple-todos</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>At this point we should get a directory structure which is written in the manual. And, behold, that&#8217;s exactly what happened. As usually, creating a skeleton is easy. Lets run the app. For that, the command is:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>I can do that, I think.</p>

<p>And sure enough, I&#8217;ve got this little message, which I actually expected to see:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">Can<span style="color: #ff0000;">'t listen on port 3000. Perhaps another Meteor is running?</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>In this world, where there are tons of applications running on your dev environment at any given time, it&#8217;s possible to have something already running on the port 3000. Luckily this is something that&#8217;s anticipated by now, and we are presented with an option to add in a proxy setting of our choice with &#8211;port <port>.</p>

<p>After I did that, I&#8217;ve got a nice confirm message that meteor is up and running. A quick check on the presented URL provided me with the confidence that my app is indeed reachable.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">App running at: http:<span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">//</span>localhost:<span style="color: #000000;">9999</span><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">/</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<h4 id="after-getting-started-8230">After Getting Started&#8230;</h4>

<p>Now that we know that it&#8217;s up and running we can continue with the tutorial. Up comes next a simple Todo list application with Templates. It&#8217;s telling us to replace the code in the default starter app. At this point I&#8217;m wondering if it can hotswap. It should, since javascript and HTML is dynamic so there should be no problems there, right?</p>

<p>And sure enough, the moment I replaced the code and checked on my server status, I could see this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">Client modified <span style="color: #660033;">--</span> refreshing
Meteor server restarted</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>With a brief flash of &#8220;Rebuilding&#8230;&#8221;. So it does sort of work. It did, however, restart the server it just did it without your manual intervention. Which is nice, but on a larger scale application it might prove to be a tad bit annoying. For example, I add another item to the list, and suddenly, the server is restarted.</p>

<p>Since, I am a tester, let&#8217;s see how it handles some problems.</p>

<p>I modified the JavaScript so that it has a syntax error.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">

my_cool_app.js:<span style="color: #000000;">10</span>:<span style="color: #000000;">7</span>: Unexpected token <span style="color: #7a0874; font-weight: bold;">&#123;</span>
&nbsp;
Your application has errors. Waiting <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">for</span> <span style="color: #c20cb9; font-weight: bold;">file</span> change.</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>It even tells you where the error is and it&#8217;s waiting for you to fix it. After I&#8217;ve corrected my error it compiled fine and the application is up and running. Deleting the files did little difference as did corrupting the HTML pages or the CSS file. Nothing to see here, moving on&#8230;</p>

<h4 id="android-device">Android Device</h4>

<p>I&#8217;m sure everybody can read a manual and continue with collections, forms, events and such. What I&#8217;m more interested in is that Meteor promises it can run on Android devices. Now that perked my curiosity. With the rise of mobile devices, the desktop platform is slowly pushed back into a dark corner where even a <a href="http://mistborn.wikia.com/wiki/Tineye" target="_blank">Tineye </a>would have problems seeing it.</p>

<p>Hence, I want to see how easy it really is.</p>

<p>Meteor gives you a set of commands to install the android sdk and droid support for your application, which is nice. You just need to run this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor install-sdk android
meteor add-platform android <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;"># Perform this step in the app's folder and agree to terms and conditions.</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now, if you are like me, someone who has experience with the android SDK and its emulator, you&#8217;ll know that running that thing requires more time and processing power than simulating the chances of Leonardo DiCaprio winning an Oscar. I&#8217;ll use a real device instead. For that, it appears I only have to run a simple command again.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="bash" style="font-family:monospace;">meteor run android-device</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>And sure enough the app appeared on my device.</p>

<p>This is actually quite awesome. I only plugged in my device, enabled developer options and USB debugging and that&#8217;s it. I&#8217;m quite impressed so far with Meteor and the Power of JavaScript. The app is on my phone and the static JavaScript parts are still working even though I shut the server down.</p>

<p>So my next burning question is&#8230; Will it Blend? I mean, Perform?</p>

<h4 id="benchmarking">Benchmarking</h4>

<p>So, now that I know that using, installing and getting started is pretty simple, what I also would like to know is how well it performs.</p>

<p>I have a quad core i7 16GB RAM Samsung SSD running Linux. Let&#8217;s see 100 threads 10 second interval 10 times loop for a start. Look at how gorgeous this is.</p>

<p>40ms on average. Now let&#8217;s crank it up and I&#8217;m performing the test on a separate machine but still on the same network. 1000 threads.</p>

<p>This time I&#8217;ve got a bit more churn and my pc started to fan like there is no tomorrow. But the server stayed stable. Latency did not waver for a bit. Next, 10.000 for as long as my machine can handle it&#8230;. Better save my work. Hah, my JMeter died. But it clocked at an average of 1000ms response time and the server stayed absolutely stable with no package lost, or errors.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>I can say with a full heart that I&#8217;m impressed by Meteor and I very much like it. It&#8217;s easy to use, even more easy to install and definitely can handle itself given that it&#8217;s rather lightweight. The hot swapping / server re-starting can&#8217;t be avoided, but that&#8217;s only a minor inconvenience and we got used to that already.</p>

<p>I recommend Meteor and I&#8217;ll be playing around with it a bit more for sure.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>Hi,</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s face the horrible truth:</p>

<p><strong>It&#8217;s rare / never happens that a manager / scrum master / product owner actually reads your cucumber test cases.</strong></p>

<p></p>

<p>Back in the old days, this was one of the selling points of human readable tests and DSLs. It sounds nice and I&#8217;m sure in a utopia it also works.</p>

<p>BDD is a very nice approach to write tests if used in a correct way. And I can relate that at some point, a manager or the product owner, actually writes up a draft of the tests. But that enthusiasm very rarely stays for the rest of the project.</p>

<p>Especially when you get to the point where your Cucumber test cases start to look something like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><span class="typ">Scenario</span><span class="pun">:</span> <span class="typ">User</span><span class="pln"> list
  </span><span class="typ">Given</span><span class="pln"> I post to </span><span class="str">"/users.json"</span> <span class="kwd">with</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln">
    </span><span class="str">"""
    {
      "</span><span class="pln">first_name</span><span class="str">": "</span><span class="typ">Steve</span><span class="str">",
      "</span><span class="pln">last_name</span><span class="str">": "</span><span class="typ">Richert</span><span class="str">"
    }
    """</span><span class="pln">
  </span><span class="typ">And</span><span class="pln"> I keep the JSON response at </span><span class="str">"id"</span> <span class="kwd">as</span> <span class="str">"USER_ID"</span><span class="pln">
  </span><span class="typ">When</span><span class="pln"> I </span><span class="kwd">get</span> <span class="str">"/users.json"</span><span class="pln">
  </span><span class="typ">Then</span><span class="pln"> the JSON response should have </span><span class="lit">1</span><span class="pln"> user
  </span><span class="typ">And</span><span class="pln"> the JSON response at </span><span class="str">"0"</span><span class="pln"> should be</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln">
    </span><span class="str">"""
    {
      "</span><span class="pln">id</span><span class="str">": %{USER_ID},
      "</span><span class="pln">first_name</span><span class="str">": "</span><span class="typ">Steve</span><span class="str">",
      "</span><span class="pln">last_name</span><span class="str">": "</span><span class="typ">Richert</span><span class="str">"
    }
    """</span></pre>

<p>If a product owner reads this, his reaction will be like: &#8220;What the hell is this? What&#8217;s users.json? Why is it there? Why should I even care? What&#8217;s a JSON response? Why should it match with the request? And what, if I keep the id at USER_ID? Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s easy to get overwhelmed by things like this scenario when you start introducing actors into your tests and payloads to your public API. And suddenly you&#8217;ll end up with cucumber features which no other will be able to understand but the person who wrote it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a little bit skeptic that it ever worked as intended. Sure, for a little while. But the dynamic nature of tests will surface soon enough. You can&#8217;t hide it forever.</p>

<p>The above example, if the payload and user would be hidden in a reusable code fragment behind the implementation, would look a bit more readable:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint"><span class="typ">Scenario</span><span class="pun">:</span> <span class="typ">User</span><span class="pln"> list
  </span><span class="typ">Given</span><span class="pln"> I post to user list</span> <span class="kwd">with data
</span><span class="pln">  | firstname | Steve |
  | lastname  | Richert |
</span><span class="pln">  </span><span class="typ">When</span><span class="pln"> I </span><span class="kwd">get</span> a response from the SUT<span class="pln">
  </span><span class="typ">Then</span><span class="pln"> the response should have the same user</span></pre>

<p>See? Easier to understand. I don&#8217;t care about the payload. I don&#8217;t care about the user ID, in fact, I would rather see this test as a unit test somewhere deep down in the bowls of the system. Although I can understand that you want a set of automated UATs.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure Cucumber has a couple of success stories behind his back, I just didn&#8217;t happen to come across them as of late. But please, if you have one, share it with me so I can rest easily.</p>

                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>I thought I throw my grudge out of the window against Scala and try something with it.</p>

<p>I also got my hands on a fairly new book, called: &#8220;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Scala-Practical-Functional-Programming/dp/1449367933/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422340157&sr=8-1&keywords=learning+scala+a+practical" target="_blank">Learning Scala: Practical Functional Programming for the JVM</a>&#8220;. Turns out to be a rather fun book to read. And Jason Swartz has a nice way of writing. So I wanted to play around with <a href="https://www.playframework.com/" target="_blank">Play 2 Framework</a>. It now comes packaged in <a href="https://typesafe.com/get-started" target="_blank">Activator</a>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So, I started the long path from almost zero to handle all that. I&#8217;m running the latest Ubuntu ( 14 ) and latest Java ( 8 ). The list: Scala, SBT, IntelliJ, Play ( through activator ).</p>

<p>I was pleased that, considering a network which allowed me a download speed of ~1.5MB/s ( that&#8217;s byte, not bit ), I was up and running in about 4 minutes. That&#8217;s Play running, with a test application created through activator and then imported into an IntelliJ Scala project.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m impressed.</p>

<p>I added SBT through the package manager like this:</p>

<pre><code>echo &quot;deb http://dl.bintray.com/sbt/debian /&quot; | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sbt.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sbt
</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s really simple.</p>

<p>After that, I did an apt-get on the latest Scala.</p>

<p>I already had IntelliJ.</p>

<p>Activator download took me ~1 minute; then I executed the command to create a test app:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code class="language-bash">&lt;span class="pln">$ activator new my&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">-&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">first&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">-&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">app play&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">-&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">scala&lt;/span></code></pre>

<p>Simple. Activator downloaded everything my system was still missing.</p>

<p>Then run the start command:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code class="language-bash">&lt;span class="pln">$ cd my&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">-&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">first&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pun">-&lt;/span>&lt;span class="pln">app
$ activator&lt;/span></code></pre>

<p>And you are ready to rock &amp; roll. Importing it in IntelliJ was a blink of an eye.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m really impressed with how easy getting started became with these projects and frameworks. I remember a time where I had to configure everything, get tomcat and the whole JVM or Jetty or whatnot, and try to get up and running took half a day at least. Would my internet be faster, I think this would have been even less.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post more as I go forward.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>Today, I would like to write about little observation I made along the way of being a tester.</p>

<p>The title says it all. I think Testers, are like scientists. I would go even further, and say: Testers, are scientists.</p>

<p>Let us see how the two compare.</p>

<p></p>

<h3 id="asking-questions">Asking Questions</h3>

<p>A scientist is all about asking the right question to the right person, or the right subject matter. They are using the same 5 Ws as we are. Who, Why, What, When, Where. It&#8217;s simple, really. Asking the right question is sometimes the most difficult task of them all. Ideas come from these questions. They can also help in flushing out early design problems with the experiment / product.</p>

<h4 id="identify-the-subject-matter">Identify the subject matter</h4>

<p>This one is all about getting to know your environment and taking notes while you are doing so. Become familiar with what you are working with, and what tools you are using in your research. Which standards are you following, and why? It&#8217;s the same, when a Tester finds herself/himself in a new environment and tries to get her(is) bearing what the task is and how to perform it.</p>

<h4 id="first-impression-outline-of-an-idea">First impression, outline of an idea</h4>

<p>The first impression will result in a vague idea of what the problem is about. This is the stage where the first thoughts emerge and the first draft of a possible solution is crafted into existence. This is the part where a person will draw information, power, and knowledge from her(is) past resulting in a solution that can get close to a real one; but rarely is this solution the one which will be chosen in the end.</p>

<h4 id="testing">Testing</h4>

<p>Indeed in the life of a scientist it is imperative that ideas, solutions and vague drafts of brainstormed possibilities are <strong>tested all the way through. </strong>For a tester it&#8217;s just as important that all the cases are verified and &#8216;approved&#8217; by either common sense, the requirements, or any other kind of verification that they can come up in certain environments. Fact is, that if a solution / test case is a valid one, depends on several different options based on any given circumstance. That is why it&#8217;s difficult to decide if something is acceptable or not. What is a good solution in one case, might be entirely wrong in another.</p>

<h4 id="results">Results</h4>

<p>If the tests / variables / cases / solutions are satisfying, then we can come to think about producing an actual result. The result could be anything of value to the observer. A failing test could be a good result, if we actually were waiting for that test to fail. In that case the result is a success. So bare in mind that a failing test, a failed solution to an experiment, is <strong>always </strong>also information which <strong>tells you something important. </strong>Never dismiss a failing test, a failed experiment, a failed solution. It gives you a <strong>hint </strong>for a passing one.</p>

<h4 id="community-and-sharing">Community and Sharing</h4>

<p>Scientists have a large community where they are sharing experiments and discoveries. I think I don&#8217;t have to draw a parallel here. We all know several testing pages, forums, events, gatherings where there are people talking about the subject matter. I&#8217;m proud that it such a long way.</p>

<h4 id="practice-practice-practice">Practice, practice, practice</h4>

<p>I think this one is self explanatory. In order to become good at something, we have to continuously do it. There is no magic formula, no pill you can take, no matrix to download Kung Fu, you have to do it to learn it. You have to practice it, gather experience and share / write them down in order to strengthen your knowledge and understanding about it. Writing it out, and sharing information, <strong>explaining it to somebody else, </strong>will make it stick better and increase your knowledge in return. So start a blog now, even if you will have only a few readers it will be worth it. Just by writing a couple of lines about something will make you remember it better, and your understanding of it deeper.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. I think these are pretty good points that let&#8217;s us identify ourselves. It&#8217;s called Computer <strong>science</strong> for a reason.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>This time I&#8217;d like to write about the expressiveness of a Test. I think that it&#8217;s very important to write understandable and expressive tests. In older times I was studying novel writing. There is a rule which a novel needs to follow. It goes something like this: &#8220;A novel needs to lead its reader and make him understand in the simplest way what&#8217;s going on, with whom and why?&#8221;. In other words, it&#8217;s not a puzzle. It should be obvious what the test is trying to do and it should not require the reader to try and solve it in order to understand it.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I&#8217;m planning this as a series since there are multiple problems with a test I can talk about here.</p>

<p><strong>Geb Tests</strong></p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at homepages"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            at HomePage

<p>Now, read this test. It doesn&#8217;t really make any sense at the first read, right? You need to actually think what is going on there. Of course if you read it slow enough you&#8217;ll get what it&#8217;s trying to do. But you don&#8217;t know what fillform does. Apparently it also submits the form because after fillform you are suddenly at MyAccountPage.</p>

<p>There are several things wrong with this one, let&#8217;s start with the pageobject.</p>

<p><strong>PageObjects</strong></p>

<p>At and toAt return page objects. We can use that to actually make the calling explicit and make it more readable and identify where a function comes from.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at homepages"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I entir my credential"</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I can accass my wallet"</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> <span style="color: #CC0099;">contains</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Balance"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This reads much better now. You know where the function is coming from and your IDE will not go nuts from things it can&#8217;t find. And you have autocompletion so there is no fear that you simply mistype something.</p>

<p><strong>Side effects</strong></p>

<p>Next step, let&#8217;s remove some of the side effects.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"login to the home page"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at homepages"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I entir my credential"</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">submitLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I can accass my wallet"</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">accountIsDisplayed</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Now this is again much better. There are no steps left out. And you can test now the FillForm and the submit independently. Like, submitting the form without filling it out! Or filling it out and not submiting it. Reads better, is explicit, more easy to understand.</p>

<p>And the last one for today:</p>

<p><strong>Grammar</strong></p>

<p>I wonder if you noticed it&#8230; The grammar is a little bit off in the tests. A small mistake here and there. You might think that, who cares? That&#8217;s a very bad thought. I think the correct grammar reflects caring. It reflects that we thought about this test and that we thought about the quality of it. Because it means that after you wrote it, you actually re-read the test to make sure it&#8217;s understandable and readable.</p>

<p>So let us correct that:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">def</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"As a player I can log in to check my account."</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span>
        given: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I am at the homepage"</span>
            go <span style="color: #ff0000;">"http://localhost:8080/home"</span>
            HomePage homePage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at HomePage
&nbsp;
        when: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I enter my log in credentials."</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">filloutLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"username"</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">"password"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            homePage.<span style="color: #006600;">submitLoginForm</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            MyAccountPage myAccountPage <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> at MyAccountPage
&nbsp;
        then: <span style="color: #ff0000;">"I'm directed to my account page."</span>
            myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">openWallet</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>
            waitFor <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#123;</span> myAccountPage.<span style="color: #006600;">accountIsDisplayed</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span>
    <span style="color: #66cc66;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>I also took the liberty of re-phrasing some of the text so that it shows what the test is about and what the user really would like to achieve here. Now try reading that last one. Does it make more sense? Did you understand it at first go? Did it read like a good story?</p>

<p>There is a coding practice which goes something like this: &#8220;Good code is code which doesn&#8217;t surprise you as you read it.&#8221; Which means the exact thing happens which you thought of would happen. I think that applies to tests as well. The steps of the test shouldn&#8217;t come to you as a surprise. Especially if you know what the application is supposed to do.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s all for today folks. Thank you for reading! If you have a nasty test which you would like me to dissect and make it better and human readable, please share it in the comment section and I will do my best to come up with a good solution for it.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>I would like to share with you a small script I wrote to update all, or a single, Jenkins job from a Python script remotely.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This will enable you to update a Jenkins job from anywhere using an admin credential based on a config.xml template that you have. With this, if you want to apply a config change to all or just a single job in Jenkins, you don&#8217;t have to go and do it for all the rest. You just call this script and it will cycle through all the jobs you have and update them if the begin with &#8220;yourpipelinedelimiter&#8221; or if they aren&#8217;t in a restricted list of jobs. The delimiter helps to identify pipelines which are dev pipelines. If you have multiple pipelines which are helpers or builders and you don&#8217;t usually apply the same config to them, than the delimiter can help identify the dev pipelines you actually want to update.</p>

<p>Enjoy, hope it helps someone.</p>

<p>And now, without any further ado:</p>

                        <p>Hi Folks!</p>

<p>I just wanted to share with you my mind map on the seven principles of Context Driven Testing.</p>

<p>I used the notion of dragons since it&#8217;s seven. And a dragon is usually seven headed in my mind&#8230;</p>

<p>So without further ado&#8230;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Click for larger image.</p>

<p>I have a hand drawn as well but I&#8217;m guessing that one wouldn&#8217;t be of much use since it follows my own imagination.</p>

<p>Here are the seven principles in points which correspond to the leafs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Value -&gt; Practice -&gt; Depends -&gt; Context =&gt; The value of any practice depends on its context.</li>
<li>People -&gt; Working -&gt; Together -&gt; Important =&gt; People, working together, are the most important part of any project’s context. ( The mob, trying to kill the dragon by working together. )</li>
<li>Problem -&gt; Project -&gt; Solution =&gt; The product is a solution. If the problem isn’t solved, the product doesn’t work. ( The sword. It&#8217;s a sword but if it doesn&#8217;t kill the Dragon it&#8217;s useless. )</li>
<li>Good Testing -&gt; Intellectual Challenge =&gt; Good software testing is a challenging intellectual process. ( Well it&#8217;s a dragon with glasses. That&#8217;s something you rarely see. )</li>
<li>Good Practice | Bad Practice -&gt; In Context -&gt; No Best Practices =&gt; There are good practices in context, but there are no best practices. ( This one was a little bit tricky. But basically you want to solve the dungeon and not plow through it )</li>
<li>Uncertainty =&gt; <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.8em;">Projects unfold over time in ways that are often not predictable. ( For me this one word was enough. )</span></li>
<li>Exercised By All In Time -&gt; Judgement | Skill | Cooperatively =&gt; Only through judgment and skill, exercised cooperatively throughout the entire project, are we able to do the right things at the right times to effectively test our products. ( It&#8217;s a flexing dragon&#8230; Easy, right? )</li>
</ol>

<p>So this map helped me to remember everything. The descriptions, applications that are further described I remembered by using this mind map as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci" target="_blank">loci</a>.</p>

<p>I hope somebody found this useful.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;d like to write a little bit about a python course I did.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s an 8 week course on algorithmic programming with fun little projects. I&#8217;d like to write down some of my solutions with pseudo code for my own better understanding and for the sake of sharing knowledge. I won&#8217;t, however, share full projects since that would be against the honour code.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s begin&#8230;</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Week Zero</strong></p>

<p>This week was all about getting the hang out of reading the posts and the documentation and the questions and getting used to the wordings. The tutors really out did themselves. They tried to make a course that can be both funny and teach something at the same time which is anything but easy.</p>

<p>Even though the tasks that were given were interesting al-bight at times a little bit far stretched and could have been easier done if used something else to complete them. But if we would have done that, what&#8217;s the point of it all then?</p>

<p>So I&#8217;ll try to recall everything solely based on my notes taken in those 8 weeks. Let&#8217;s see how much I truly learned.</p>

<p><strong>Assignment of week one</strong></p>

<p>We were to build the game 2048 which if you played you know what it is all about.</p>

<div style="width: 225px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
  <img src="http://ironyca.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/2048-game.jpg?w=500&h=666" alt="" width="215" height="287" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">

  </p>
</div>

<p>The goal is to add up numbers so that higher and higher numbers are created. There is no real &#8220;end&#8221; of the game. You can continue as long as you have space left although the intended goal is to create 2048. There are a couple of clones of this game and we were supposed to write one this time of our own.</p>

<p>We approached this game with the intention of refreshing our memory about Python. Handling matrices python syntax, counting indices and a bit of assessment about the general understanding of Mathematics and programming from the populace.</p>

<p>I must say it was hard. It was hard to get back into the habit of properly thinking about something at first. It was hard to get used to Math again which I missed for a very long time. I forgot many things and as English is not my first language many things written about Math in English were extremely hard to understand in the beginning.</p>

<p>But thankfully for my trusty mathematics Bible in Hungarian I was saved.</p>

<div style="width: 187px" class="wp-caption alignleft">
  <img src="http://s02.static.libri.hu/cover/9f/3/818403_5.jpg" alt="" width="177" height="248" />
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Math book
  </p>
</div>

<p>This book is 1448 pages long but contained all the information necessary to get my mind back into the game. And oh boy was it worth the initial trouble. I had to first realize that I forgot so much it was very painful and immensely disappointing, frustrating and shameful. But you should never give up and so I fought my way through it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And it was extremely helpful to do Tests First. As the grading was based on how many of a given set of Unit Tests were passing it was very helpful to start tests first which were leading the design of the program. Also it was crucial to work in as little chunks as possible since one could easily lost himself trying to grasp a problem proving to be too large to look at from afar.</p>

<p>The hard part about this project was the Merging of the numbers and creating the proper grid which results from the Merge. Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[2, 0, 2, 4]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 4, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[0, 0, 2, 2]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 0, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[2, 2, 0, 0]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 0, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[2, 2, 2, 2]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[4, 4, 0, 0]</code></li>
<li><code style="color: #dd1144;">[8, 16, 16, 8]</code> should return <code style="color: #dd1144;">[8, 32, 8, 0]</code></li>
</ul>

<p>In order to achieve this you must trim the zeros like this <span style="color: #ff0000;">[2,2,4]</span> and than produce the result which is <span style="color: #ff0000;">[4,4]</span> and put a couple of zeros at the end <span style="color: #ff0000;">[4,4,0,0]</span>. My first though was to use the Deque class in Python in order to achieve this but that was an outside module which was not allowed.</p>

<p>It was an interesting way to begin the course. Many people left at this point and were leaving afterwards too. Most of them in frustration that they were missing the python knowledge the rest out of frustration of not knowing the necessary math. At the end though it was getting easier to follow the problems after we got used to the conventions and sentence structures. The professors were also helpful and sometimes re-worded some of the descriptions to better describe what they wanted.</p>

<p><strong>Week One</strong></p>

<p>So after a hard start we moved on to a very interesting week one. This one got me into a certain game I don&#8217;t want to see ever again&#8230; It&#8217;s name: <strong><a title="Cookie Clicker" href="http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/" target="_blank">Cookie Clicker</a>.</strong></p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130827014912/cookieclicker/images/5/5a/PerfectCookie.png" alt="" width="203" height="203" /></p>

<p>We sort of had to re-create the cookie clicker but without the clicking. We only were supposed to re-create the buying of upgrades and simulate a sequence of clicks via the means of a cycle.</p>

<p>In this week the description of the tasks was, at the least, confusing. They started to use the term _time _which lead many to believe that we were somehow supposed to use python&#8217;s date / time methods and libraries. But after a couple of re-reads it was apparent that by _time <em>they actually were referring to </em><strong>cycle count.</strong>_<strong> </strong></p>

<p>Knowing this made the task at hand a lot easier. This time around our main focus were the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mathematical Sums</li>
<li>Finding the Max</li>
<li>Higher &#8211; Order functions</li>
<li>Plotting with Python</li>
</ul>

<p>The course just went into overdrive. We were looking a lot at thing like these:</p>

<p><span id="MathJax-Span-185" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-186" class="munderover"><span id="MathJax-Span-187" class="mo">∑</span><span id="MathJax-Span-193" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">n i=0 </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-194" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-195" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^</span><span id="MathJax-Span-196" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">i </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-197" class="mo">= </span><span id="MathJax-Span-198" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-199" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^</span><span id="MathJax-Span-200" class="mn">0 </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-201" class="mo">+ </span><span id="MathJax-Span-202" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-203" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^</span><span id="MathJax-Span-204" class="mn">1 </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-205" class="mo">+ </span><span id="MathJax-Span-206" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-207" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^</span><span id="MathJax-Span-208" class="mn">2 </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-209" class="mo">+ </span><span id="MathJax-Span-210" class="mo">.</span><span id="MathJax-Span-211" class="mo">.</span><span id="MathJax-Span-212" class="mo">. </span><span id="MathJax-Span-213" class="mo">+ </span><span id="MathJax-Span-214" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-215" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^</span><span id="MathJax-Span-216" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">n </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-217" class="mo">= </span><span id="MathJax-Span-218" class="mfrac"><span id="MathJax-Span-219" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-220" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-221" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α^(</span><span id="MathJax-Span-222" class="texatom"><span id="MathJax-Span-223" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-224" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">n</span><span id="MathJax-Span-225" class="mo">+</span><span id="MathJax-Span-226" class="mn">1) </span></span></span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-227" class="mo">− </span><span id="MathJax-Span-228" class="mn">1 / </span></span><span id="MathJax-Span-229" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-230" class="mi" style="font-style: italic;">α </span><span id="MathJax-Span-231" class="mo">− </span><span id="MathJax-Span-232" class="mn">1</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>It was rather awesome though frustrating at first like I wrote earlier. These were the easier one.</p>

<p>Finding the maximum is trivial. Especially if you are using a built in <strong>max </strong>provided by Python. But if you mix it with Higher-Order functions it gets interesting. If you want to do anything else as well and not just a max, for example getting the index of the maximum item as well, you usually end up writing a custom Max any ways.</p>

<p>Plotting in Python was exquisite interesting. The garphs which were produced showed as an insight into how powerful a solution really is or how effective. Here came in the Big-O notations almost. To see if a function was exponential, logarithmic or plain polynomial. O(n), O(n^2), O(logn) etc, etc.</p>

<p>This resulted in very interesting graphs like this:</p>

<p><strong>Week Two</strong></p>

<p>So last week we had plotting and counting this week was even more interesting. Week Two&#8217;s main focus was <strong>Probability</strong>. Specifically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method" target="_blank"><strong>Monte Carlo</strong> <strong>methods</strong></a>. Tl;dr; it describes that if you try something enough times you can derive a result that will be, with very high probability, the one you are looking for (expected value).</p>

<p>We tried out this algorithm by playing a nice game of tic-tac-toe.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.janetkruskamp.com/Images/TicTacToe.jpg" alt="" width="227" height="227" /></p>

<p>The point of this exercise was to create a machine player which, after running a 1000 or so random scenarios, was choosing the best option given a certain game state. It was difficult to get the results to always return a correct answer. At this point last weeks plotting became important since if your Monet Carlo algorithm was not fast enough the program was running increasingly slower and slower.</p>

<p>I was not very satisfied with my solution. It worked, but it was very slow and it wasn&#8217;t always returning the best option&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Week Three</strong></p>

<p>So what comes after probability? Correct. <strong>Combinatorics. </strong></p>

<p>The next hill to climb was combinatorics. Fortunately for me I love probability and combinatorics so this was a little bit easier for me. I was getting the hang out of function calculation as well so I wrote better homework and better projects at this point. Which is the aim of the course, right?</p>

<p>The game we used for this approach was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahtzee" target="_blank"><strong>Yahtzee</strong></a>.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://playpop.com/medias/images/splashscreens/yahtzee_en.png" alt="" width="279" height="201" /></p>

<p>Now let me say this without too much remorse. I truly, fully and with all my heart, hate Yahtzee. I think it&#8217;s stupid. I&#8217;m sorry. I truly do. The only thing I can think of when I hear yahtzee is the South Park version of it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>South Park Version of Yahtzee + Tron:</p>

<p>I share the enthusiastic look of Stan here.</p>

<p>Anyhow, moving on&#8230; Thank to the coursera Gods we weren&#8217;t suppose to write a whole game of Yathzee just a very simplified version of it. We were supposed to count the upper combinations on the second throw. So you already have one throw and you must choose how many die you want to hold on to to maximise the possibility of the best outcome possible. Huh&#8230; come again?</p>

<p>So you already had a hand. And now the program was to determine which die you were supposed to hold on too in order to maximise the score you can achieve with the remaining two throws.</p>

<p>There were a few interesting things that came in with this task. For example this was the first time I could use a Dict init from a list with a zip.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;">hand_dict <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> <span style="color: #008000;">dict</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">zip</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #008000;">list</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span>hand<span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span><span style="color: #ff4500;"></span><span style="color: black;">&#93;</span>*<span style="color: #008000;">len</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span>hand<span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>And this was the point in course were I found perhaps the most interesting thing. I found an actual use for reduce which was working. I was beginning to get into the habit of using map, filter, reduce.</p>

<p>This was the beauty:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;">my_list <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> <span style="color: #008000;">reduce</span><span style="color: black;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">lambda</span> z<span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> x: z + <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span>y + <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span>x<span style="color: black;">&#93;</span> <span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">for</span> y <span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">in</span> z<span style="color: black;">&#93;</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> hand<span style="color: #66cc66;">,</span> <span style="color: black;">&#91;</span><span style="color: black;">&#91;</span><span style="color: black;">&#93;</span><span style="color: black;">&#93;</span><span style="color: black;">&#41;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This piece of code produced all the combinations of a given hand which was a list of Tuples. It merged them into a list of lists which I created a list of Tuples out from. After this my life was never ever the same again.</p>

<p><strong>Week Four</strong></p>

<p>For me this was the most interesting part of the course. I LOVED this task. Focus was:</p>

<ul>
<li>Python Generators</li>
<li>Stacks / Queues</li>
<li>Inheritance in Python</li>
<li>Girds</li>
<li>Grid Search / <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search" target="_blank">Breadth First Search</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And the task with which we were supposed to achieve this was&#8230;. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Zombie Apocalypse</strong></span>. It was sort of like <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway&#8217;s Game of Life</a></strong>. Given a grid in which there were <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Zombies</strong></span><strong> </strong>and <span style="color: #000000;"><strong><span style="color: #339966;">Humans </span></strong></span> <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Obstacles.</span></strong></p>

<p>The Zombies could only move up, down, left, right. The humans could flee diagonally and none of them could penetrate an obstacle. It was very much fun to write this. The most challenge was to learn the proper implementation of the breadth first search algorithm as the Zombies had to detect the nearest Humans to move towards to and the Humans needed to see the nearest Zombies to flee from.</p>

<p><strong>Week Five</strong></p>

<p>Halfway through it was become difficult to maintain the time needed for this course. I was finding myself applying a few late days here and there. This was a two months course after all. I did not have all the time in the world at my disposal. But I managed to submit everything without penalties.</p>

<p>So this weeks task was rather mundane. It was a <strong>world wrangler</strong>. Which means given a word generate valid words from the letters in the provided word.</p>

<p>The algorithm we were supposed to use though was for me a bit of a challenge. I&#8217;ll be honest with you, for me, it was a little bit hard to wrap my head around this one. But eventually I succeeded.</p>

<p>It was Merge-Sort and Recursion. Let me tell you this now, I hate merge-sort. Recursion I do love though. What I never learned though and was very interesting for me to learn now was recurrences in mathematics. Well never learned is a bit harsh since I knew Fibonacci already and Pascal&#8217;s Triangle but the mathematical definition was a refreshing new view. I&#8217;m talking about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recurrence_relation" target="_blank"><strong>Recurrence Relations</strong></a>.</p>

<p><img class="mwe-math-fallback-png-inline tex" style="color: #252525;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/a/4/1a4da05124f61db47a4805b411ff8c3b.png" alt="F_n = F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}" /></p>

<p>This is the Recurrence relation of the famous Fibonacci. Easy, right? Well the hard part is when you are trying to get the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binet_formula#Closed-form_expression" target="_blank"><strong>closed-form-expression</strong></a> of a Recurrence.</p>

<p><strong>Week Six</strong></p>

<p>Finally it was coming to an end. The last week was easy so this week had to have a punch. And oh boy it did. This weeks focus:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trees</li>
<li>Lambdas</li>
<li>Illustration of Trees</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax" target="_blank">Minimax</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search" target="_blank">Depth First Search</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If I hated merge-sort I hated minimax more. I don&#8217;t know why but it was again very hard for me to properly grasp this concept. I mean I understood what needed to be done of course but writing it done with code proved to be more difficult then I thought it would be.</p>

<p>After hours of research and reading finally I could come up with a solution which was working. I wouldn&#8217;t say it was good&#8230; But it was working.</p>

<p>The game with which we were supposed to demonstrate this algorithm was&#8230; Tic-Tac-Toe. Turns out that it&#8217;s rather common place to show off minimax with tic-tac-toe as it was fewer possibilities. The point of the exercise was the following&#8230;:</p>

<p><img class="alignnone" src="http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~yosenl/extras/alphabeta/alphabeta.jpg" alt="" width="516" height="405" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To create trees out of the possible moves given a certain game state. This time we wanted to make absolutely sure that if we can&#8217;t win the game at least we won&#8217;t loose it. And that&#8217;s the point of minimax. It will minimize your losses.</p>

<p>Now there are several things about this algorithm that are hard.</p>

<p><strong>Performance of Minimax</strong></p>

<p>It has and always will be a very interesting task for programmers to try to achieve a better performance for these calculations. Since it&#8217;s trying to build up a tree with all the possible combinations a game can have it will end up with a huge tree which will take ages to traverse.</p>

<p>A few of the solutions could be to exit the search once you have a definitive answer. If you find a winning move there is no point of looking any further. You just stop.</p>

<p>You can create the tree dynamically. You can make it somehow intelligent enough to predict a possible best first move and then use minimax on the rest. Or use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning" target="_blank"><strong>Alpha-beta pruning</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Week Seven</strong></p>

<p>And so we are coming to an end. Last weeks assignment was basically to put all the previous weeks knowledge together to create the application called 15 puzzle.</p>

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://kociemba.org/fifteen/pics/puz.jpg" alt="" width="183" height="183" /></p>

<p>Now, there was however a little addition to the previous knowledge. It was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(computer_science)" target="_blank"><strong>invariants</strong></a>. Now, I love Logic. And I&#8217;ve been actually using invariants in computer science programming and testing for a long time so this part was not really a problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An example of an invariant in python would be something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">while</span> x &lt<span style="color: #66cc66;">;=</span> <span style="color: #ff4500;">5</span>:
  x <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> x + <span style="color: #ff4500;">1</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This is a loop invariant example. In you find a very useful invariant in your program you can write an assert for it which will help you debug your code and work in small chunks. Invariants will make refactoring your code a hell of a lot easier. As if your invariant is suddenly false you need to check what went wrong.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="python" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">while</span> x &lt<span style="color: #66cc66;">;=</span> <span style="color: #ff4500;">5</span>:
  x <span style="color: #66cc66;">=</span> x + <span style="color: #ff4500;">1</span>
  <span style="color: #ff7700;font-weight:bold;">assert</span> x &lt<span style="color: #66cc66;">;=</span> <span style="color: #ff4500;">6</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This assert will make sure that if your invariant for whatever reason isn&#8217;t true your code fails immediately.</p>

<p><strong>End Credits</strong></p>

<p>So this was the end of the course. I learned a a lot from this course and I&#8217;m very proud of myself for completing it. I took away a lot from this course. I took away confidence and logical thinking. I took away greater trust in my Python knowledge and that it&#8217;s very important to keep my skills from deteriorating.</p>

<p>And I think math is important for proper, deep understanding of programming as a science. I think refreshing my math skills gave me at least a deeper trust in my ability to write a piece of code however complicated it might appear. After writing a minimax algorithm I think some Hibernate with DIP and SRP will prove to be less of a problem. Or at least a different category of a problem&#8230;. Hehe.</p>

                        <p>Hello Folks.</p>

<p>So last I was writing about why a tester should learn Javascript. Today I would like to write about why a tester should learn SQL.</p>

<p>There, I said it. I know many people, especially testers, don&#8217;t like SQL. They view it as a monster best be avoided. Something only Database people will know. Something which is so scary and ugly, nobody really wants it.</p>

<p>But I will give you a couple of good reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t be afraid of SQL. And why you should welcome it as your best friend and partner in crime.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Reason Number One: Data gathering</strong></p>

<p>This one is obvious and clear as the sun. You can use simple queries to mine for data. To look up changes and compare time intervals between insertion and update events. You can monitor certain tables so that when they are updated, you&#8217;ll get a red flag.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number Two: Test Run Statistics</strong></p>

<p>This one is from my friend Adrian. Basically if you would like to know more about what&#8217;s happening with your tests when they run, for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run time</li>
<li>Frequency of Test outcome</li>
<li>Failure rate</li>
<li>Environment details -&gt; Execution slave</li>
</ul>

<p>One interesting way to achieve this is, to have the test report running and outcomes into a little mysql database and than create queries of certain types like, show me the last run of every test called xyz and show me the environmental details and the run time. With this closely monitored you could find out that Slave #345 is sluggish because each time the test ran on it, it took more then 10 minutes where as the others only took 5-6.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number Three: Data Manipulation</strong></p>

<p>So after monitoring comes naturally the edit. Understanding how databases work and knowing a few queries here and there can help you manipulating your data in a way that it will be easier to test data dependant scenarios.</p>

<p>Instead of making a new entry you could edit what you already have.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>You have a customer and you want to test the system&#8217;s ability to handle people on your site who are suspended from access. But the ability to suspend is not yet working. Will that stop you from testing this feature? Will you put this feature into blocked because: &#8220;Ohh, we can&#8217;t yet suspend a player so we need to wait until that&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>

<p>No. You don&#8217;t wait. You dig into your database, find the necessary record, change it&#8217;s state to the desired state; even if it has a foreign key which needs to be updated or that status doesn&#8217;t exist yet, in which case you ADD it to the list of states yourself. You don&#8217;t let yourself be stopped just because something is not done yet. You move on by being clever.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number Four: Understanding Data migration issues</strong></p>

<p>A big issue these days if you go into a project where you have a previous version of what you are currently building will be migrating over old data into the new database scheme. Testing such a thing can be a pain in the butt. But it will be a LOT easier if you understand the changes. If you know what changed, how and why, you can manipulate your data in order to fit the new scheme. Or if you need to test it you won&#8217;t be afraid of running some stored procedures in a dummy database with old data and than run a few queries to see what broke and what didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Do you have a foreign key violation somewhere when you migrated over and have no idea what do to? Time to learn some SQL so that you don&#8217;t have to run to somebody every time you encounter it. Even if you can&#8217;t fix it, the database engineers or the devs who will fix the bug will be very happy that you provided as much information as possible in your report.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number Five: Security</strong></p>

<p>SQL Injection is still at large. Even with these days frameworks doing full escapes it can&#8217;t hurt to test a couple just to be on the safe side. And writing a clever script that mines for accessible tables here and there is an essential skill in a security tester&#8217;s repertoire.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Bonus: Performance, HibernateQL, Information</strong></p>

<p>Lastly a bit of a bonus are these three.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>

<p>Suppose you are running a web application. You access a large list and you notice that it&#8217;s sort of sluggish. You first blame it on the network so you test it locally. It seems to be better now so you move on but it leaves a little voice in your head so you can&#8217;t abandon it. You go back and try locally again with a bit more data in your database.</p>

<p>You notice it&#8217;s a little bit better but it&#8217;s still somehow sluggish. Suddenly you get a hunch and turn on SQL logging in your tomcat instance. You click the link again and wait with eyes wide open on what happens next. It&#8217;s your worst nightmare.</p>

<p>The SQL queries the whole database with a simple select and than filters the data on the front-end side. Which is a really really dumb thing to do. So you file a bug for which the title is something similar to this: &#8220;Customer Transaction History query doesn&#8217;t apply WHERE | INNER SELECT | PAGING on SQL rather it filters on the application layer.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>HibernateQL</strong></p>

<p>This is the SQL language of hibernate which is the underlying technology in many java web frameworks these days. It uses it&#8217;s own thing called <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/3.3/reference/en/html/queryhql.html" target="_blank">HQL</a>. Main difference, as this page already says, is that it&#8217;s a full blown Object Oriented query language which understand inheritance and polymorphism which is very exciting.</p>

<p><strong>Information</strong></p>

<p>Last but not least I mentioned this one earlier. You can provide more information in your bug reports as in what data you used, where was it happening, what was the last update date, which environment and what query was executed ( if you have query debugging turned on ). Whoever reads that bug report will find it very helpful that you provided enough information to reproduce it anywhere.</p>

<p>Because many times the culprit for a bug is the underlying data.</p>

<p><strong>Reading and Practising resources</strong></p>

<p>Here is a very awesome picture of how to understand JOINS which is everybody&#8217;s fear.</p>

<div style="width: 976px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

</div>

<p>And a post on <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/a-visual-explanation-of-sql-joins/" target="_blank">Coding Horror</a> which is essentially the same but I like how Jeff writes.</p>

<p>Also if you would like to practice writing SQL scripts and no longer be afraid of them all the rest of your life go to this site =&gt; <a href="http://sqlzoo.net/" target="_blank">SQLZoo</a>. It&#8217;s an interactive way of trying out your SQL skills and testing them on very clever database structures.</p>

<p>But if you, like me, love to learn PLAYING than THIS is the place for you =&gt; <a href="https://schemaverse.com/" target="_blank">The Schemaverse</a>. It&#8217;s a SQL based space shooting strategy game awesomeness! Have FUN learning SQL.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Have a nice day|night!</p>

                        <p>Is TDD dead?</p>

<p>Not really. So let&#8217;s talk about this topic for a little bit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you already read a gazillion posts about this debate but frankly I&#8217;m writing this for myself, to rant a little bit, you know&#8230; Because somebody is wrong on the internet and I must intervene.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So first of all, the hashtag #tddisdead (and I will use it shamelessly as well). This is clearly an attempt to get as many peoples attention as you can. TDD is NOT DEAD. Obviously since it has soooo many supporters how could it be dead? It&#8217;s like asking, is Design Patterns dead? Or is Functional Automation dead? Or is Oreo cookies dead?</p>

<p>No, it&#8217;s not dead. And it won&#8217;t ever be dead. It will maybe change into something new, something better even, but it will never be dead. So let&#8217;s skip that part.</p>

<p>Now, about the <strong>debate</strong>.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t hear so much bull spoken for this long since I watched the political debate of two fractions in my home country. The right wing extremists against the left wing&#8230;. I don&#8217;t know whats. And it was just that. A political debate. It had no merit and no value whatsoever. At all. Nothing.</p>

<p>And right in the middle <strong>DHH</strong> says this:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;you&#8217;re not done until you also have tests for a piece of functionality &#8212; I&#8217;m completely on board with that.&#8221;.</em></p>

<p>That made the whole conversation completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>Every counter against TDD I heard was <strong>bull</strong>. Not in that debate, in general. People are either too lazy to write them, just don&#8217;t want to get out of their comfort zone, don&#8217;t really care about tests, or don&#8217;t really care about quality or under time pressure ( I get to this later. ).</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<p><strong>Quality</strong></p>

<p>People seem to not care about quality that much. Would they, they would understand that having a bulletproof west will save your life when you get shot in the chest with a 357 magnum. You can flush out early design flaws you can detect early bugs and do a better system design.</p>

<p>Sure if you are the most intelligent man on the planet maybe you can come up with a perfect system on the first draft and then implement it flawlessly so that it doesn&#8217;t fall apart in two months time. But most people can&#8217;t. Most people make errors on the way.</p>

<p>And yes, writing tests can be hard. But guess what? If writing a test is hard because that part of the system is complicated, than it will be that part of the system which will react the worst to change. And only change is constant. Which brings me to the next item&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Time constraints</strong></p>

<p>So your manager is sitting right next to you and saying come on we are paying you to write code and not tests so do it! And you have to have a feature done today but if you write a suite of tests you&#8217;ll only finish tomorrow. Sure, your estimate at that point will become a very quick one because you make a sacrifice of trust.</p>

<p>And then the next story comes along and you say&#8230; <em>&#8220;Sure I can do that as well. No problem I know how my system works, right? Hmm&#8230; why the hell did that break all of a sudden? I didn&#8217;t change anything in that module&#8230; Ahh damn it I said I&#8217;ll be done today, so let&#8217;s just fix this quickly and then move on to the next card.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>And the next story comes along&#8230; <em>&#8220;Sure I can do that&#8230; wait a minute&#8230; Didn&#8217;t that part brake already twice? Damn, better refactor. Ohh shit, why is that now breaking???? Damn it I said I&#8217;ll be done tomorrow, better patch it, and then move on. Hmm let&#8217;s write a test here to make sure this does not break. Ohhh damn I need PowerMock for that stuff since it&#8217;s in another module. Why the hell is that there? Should it be here in the first place since it&#8217;s somehow used by that other class there? Interesting. Let&#8217;s refactor and put it in here so I can mock it. Ahhhh f*ck now all the rest of the system is not working. Damn, I&#8217;ll just use PowerMock. Shit. Checkstyle error. PowerMock is not allowed?? What?? Who the f*ck says that?&#8221;</em></p>

<p>You get my drift. And suddenly you end up with estimates of <strong>WEEKS</strong>!!!! instead of days / hours for a simple story.</p>

<p><strong>Finishing it up</strong></p>

<p>This a rant only. It&#8217;s my personal opinion, experience and observation of a 10 year time period in Software Testing. Starting with at least a Weak Skeleton and a few upfront tests will help you in the long run. Writing at least ONE &#8211; TWO acceptance tests WILL help you understand business logic better. Writing ONE or TWO unit tests will help you understand your logic better. I&#8217;m not saying write a whole damn suite of tests I can understand you don&#8217;t want to do that, but for quality&#8217;s sake write at least a couple.</p>

<p>You will love it, I promise you that.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
