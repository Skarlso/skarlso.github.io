                <p>Hi Folks!</p>
<p>I just wanted to share with you my mind map on the seven principles of Context Driven Testing.</p>
<p>I used the notion of dragons since it’s seven. And a dragon is usually seven headed in my mind…</p>
<p>So without further ado…</p>
<p>Click for larger image.</p>
<p>I have a hand drawn as well but I’m guessing that one wouldn’t be of much use since it follows my own imagination.</p>
<p>Here are the seven principles in points which correspond to the leafs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Value -&gt; Practice -&gt; Depends -&gt; Context =&gt; The value of any practice depends on its context.</li>
<li>People -&gt; Working -&gt; Together -&gt; Important =&gt; People, working together, are the most important part of any project’s context. ( The mob, trying to kill the dragon by working together. )</li>
<li>Problem -&gt; Project -&gt; Solution =&gt; The product is a solution. If the problem isn’t solved, the product doesn’t work. ( The sword. It’s a sword but if it doesn’t kill the Dragon it’s useless. )</li>
<li>Good Testing -&gt; Intellectual Challenge =&gt; Good software testing is a challenging intellectual process. ( Well it’s a dragon with glasses. That’s something you rarely see. )</li>
<li>Good Practice | Bad Practice -&gt; In Context -&gt; No Best Practices =&gt; There are good practices in context, but there are no best practices. ( This one was a little bit tricky. But basically you want to solve the dungeon and not plow through it )</li>
<li>Uncertainty =&gt; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Projects unfold over time in ways that are often not predictable. ( For me this one word was enough. )<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
<li>Exercised By All In Time -&gt; Judgement | Skill | Cooperatively =&gt; Only through judgment and skill, exercised cooperatively throughout the entire project, are we able to do the right things at the right times to effectively test our products. ( It’s a flexing dragon… Easy, right? )</li>
</ol>
<p>So this map helped me to remember everything. The descriptions, applications that are further described I remembered by using this mind map as a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->loci<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>I hope somebody found this useful.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
