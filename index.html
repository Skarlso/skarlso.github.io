The murderbot series is following a rouge security bot which hacked its own governor module and is self aware and free.

                    Intro Welcome. This is a longer post about how to deploy a Go backend with a React frontend on Kubernetes as separate entities. Instead of the usual compiled together single binary Go application, we are going to separate the two. Why? Because usually a React frontend is just a &ldquo;static&rdquo; SPA app with very little requirements in terms of resources, while the Go backend does most of the leg work, requiring a lot more resources.

Today I would like to share a quick &ldquo;fix&rdquo; for a problem I&rsquo;ve seen popping up here and there.
That is, if you have a react frontend which is a SPA app but you still want refresh to work. What do I mean by that? Consider the following&hellip;
The problem You have a SPA app with a react router which navigates the user around. The app calls to a backend api which serves content of some kind.

First of all if you are a helm user, Athens has an awesome set of helm charts which you can use to deploy it in your cluster. Located here.
