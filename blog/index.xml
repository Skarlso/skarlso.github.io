      <description>Reader&amp;rsquo;s Digest I thought it would a cool idea if I kept a summary of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve read or listened to on a monthly basis. Here is April of 2021 so far. Enjoy.
Invincible After seeing it air on Amazon Prime, I had to go and read the comic. It&amp;rsquo;s quite a lot, but I assure you it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. Some spoiler alerts&amp;hellip;
Okay, so we follow this guy, Mark Grayson.</description>

The Aurora Database paper The paper about Aurora database from AWS can be found here: Paper. It details the design decision taken to support a highly available, fault tolerant, fast replicating database. They take the following approach&amp;hellip; They modified mysql database such as that they only send around the redo log and the redo log is enough to recover / replicate in order to achieve write and read consistency.</description>

All systems red - Murderbot This book is SHORT. It&amp;rsquo;s little over 3 hours of listening time. I&amp;rsquo;m listening at 1.30 so it&amp;rsquo;s just short of 2 hours. But it&amp;rsquo;s entertaining. The murderbot series is following a rouge security bot which hacked its own governor module and is self aware and free.</description>

      <title>How to deploy a Go (Golang) backend with a React frontend separately on Kubernetes - Part One</title>

      <description>Intro Welcome. This is a longer post about how to deploy a Go backend with a React frontend on Kubernetes as separate entities. Instead of the usual compiled together single binary Go application, we are going to separate the two. Why? Because usually a React frontend is just a &amp;ldquo;static&amp;rdquo; SPA app with very little requirements in terms of resources, while the Go backend does most of the leg work, requiring a lot more resources.</description>

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
This time, I would like to talk a little bit about code reviews.
How do you do code reviews? Don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to share it in the comments.
How do I do code reviews? Well read on if you would like to know.
The Top Down approach If I&amp;rsquo;m dealing with a small code change, a couple of lines here and there in the odd file first, I&amp;rsquo;ll try to understand why the review is there?</description>

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
Today I would like to share a quick &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; for a problem I&amp;rsquo;ve seen popping up here and there.
That is, if you have a react frontend which is a SPA app but you still want refresh to work. What do I mean by that? Consider the following&amp;hellip;
The problem You have a SPA app with a react router which navigates the user around. The app calls to a backend api which serves content of some kind.</description>

      <description>Intro Hi folks.
This is a continuation of the previous post about my Kubernetes infrastructure located here. The two remaining points are to deploy Athens Go proxy and setting up monitoring.
Athens Let&amp;rsquo;s start with Athens.
First of all if you are a helm user, Athens has an awesome set of helm charts which you can use to deploy it in your cluster. Located here.
I prefer to deploy my own config files, but that&amp;rsquo;s me.</description>

      <description>Intro One morning I woke up and tried to access my gitea just to find that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t running.
I checked my cluster and found that the whole thing was dead as meat. I quickly jumped in and ran k get pods -A to see what&amp;rsquo;s going on. None of my services worked.
What immediately struck my eye was a 100+ pods of my fork_updater cronjob. The fork_updater cronjob which runs once a month, looks like this:</description>
