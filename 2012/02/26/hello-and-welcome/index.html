      <p>Hello Dear Visitor.</p>

<p>Welcome to the ramblings of a software test engineer who thinks that he is a tester but feels like a developer but works as a tester but wants to learn programming like a developer&#8230; And so on and so fort.</p>

<p>I will make a journey that has been done by many automation testers. The journey when you decide to step one forward. A friend of mine told me that it is good that a tester learns proper programming and that more should do so. She is right. And I will try to document this journey as best as possible. I will try to write down my experiences with java, android, automation, swing, maven, hudson, selenium, cucumber, TDD, BDD, Agile environment and whatever tool I meet.</p>

<p>Please forgive me if you find some grammar errors, English is not my first Language. At least this will be a good opportunity to practice it.</p>

<p>Have fun.. Enjoy my ramblings.</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>
