				<p>So today at 8-12PM I had a great session with two friends of mine. It was awesome. Like a mini code retreat.</p>

<p>We set down in a musky bar, drank wine and beer and cider, and decided to practice some TDD with the well known problem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway&#8217;s Game of Life</a>. This challenge is really interesting. I never done it before, ever. So it was a really good practice for me.</p>

<p>So&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>In the beginning there was Test</strong></p>

<p>One of my friends and I started out by developing the implementation for the game while the second one was mentoring and couching us. As with any problem I&#8217;m facing now days, I started with writing a failing test first. I didn&#8217;t write any kind of production code yet. I wrote a test testing for having the class called game of life.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
2
3
4
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">    @Test
    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #000066; font-weight: bold;">void</span> shouldHaveClassForGameOfLife<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
        GameOfLife gameOfLife <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">new</span> GameOfLife<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
    <span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This wasn&#8217;t compiling of course because I didn&#8217;t have any kind of GameOfLife class. But intelliJ is so intelligent that I simply pressed Alt+Enter and created the class immediately. The class didn&#8217;t have anything in it, but I already had a passing test.</p>

<p>So this went on and on and I created one test after another while my other coding friend did the same.</p>

<p><strong>Now the amazing part</strong></p>

<p>I begun working on the Grid. A simple octagonal coordinating system. This was represented in the beginning with a simple two dimensional array with Cells in it.</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">    Cells<span style="color: #009900;">&#91;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#93;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#91;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#93;</span> cells <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">new</span> Cells<span style="color: #009900;">&#91;</span><span style="color: #cc66cc;">50</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#93;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#91;</span><span style="color: #cc66cc;">50</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#93;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This of course wasn&#8217;t dynamic. I didn&#8217;t care about that yet. I had my grid of cells. These cells were initially all dead.</p>

<p>Now, the interesting part is that as I developed my Grid finding out the Cells neighbours and counting them, my friend worked on the Cells themselves and getting their next state and killing them based on the rules.</p>

<p>We never talked to each other, didn&#8217;t agree on roles or directions or anything. And even so at the and&#8230; We were at a stage where we met in the middle and could merge our codes! Our little game of life evolved with a push of a button. ( Three actually. )</p>

<p>This was simply amazing. Without ever talking about the direction we want to go we created a working code base that could be merged!</p>

<p><strong>It just works</strong></p>

<p>Before TDD I would have tackled this problem much differently. And it would have taken me much more time too. This was like an hour or so.</p>

<p>TDD helped me break down the job into small, manageable tasks. I created and deleted and rewrote tests as I went on and on and developed the algorithm for my Grid and Cell. And eventually the problem slowly unfolded itself right before my eyes. I began to see the connections. I began to see the beauty. I began to understand! This is something I rarely enjoyed previously without using TDD.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I recommend for you guys to do the same. Just sit down, find a problem, find a coding kata and just do it with TDD. With PROPER TDD.</p>

<p>Here are some good sites for katas and problems:</p>

<p><a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/">http://codekata.pragprog.com/</a></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.spoj.pl/problems/classical/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.spoj.pl/problems/classical/">http://www.spoj.pl/problems/classical/</a></a></p>

<p>Just select a problem and then start cracking on it. Do this every time you have some free time. Like a martial art trainee doing basic exercises and you will get better at problem solving and at TDD too. I promise.</p>

<p>Happy coding and good night!</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>
