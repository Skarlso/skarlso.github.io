I had my grid of cells. These cells were initially all dead.\nNow, the interesting part is that as I developed my Grid finding out the Cells neighbours and counting them, my friend worked on the Cells themselves and getting their next state and killing them based on the rules.\nWe never talked to each other, didn’t agree on roles or directions or anything. And even so at the and. We were at a stage where we met in the middle and could merge our codes! Our little game of life evolved with a push of a button. ( Three actually. )\nThis was simply amazing.

And it would have taken me much more time too. This was like an hour or so.\nTDD helped me break down the job into small, manageable tasks. I created and deleted and rewrote tests as I went on and on and developed the algorithm for my Grid and Cell. And eventually the problem slowly unfolded itself right before my eyes.

Just sit down, find a problem, find a coding kata and just do it with TDD. With PROPER TDD.\nHere are some good sites for katas and problems:\nhttp://codekata.pragprog.com/\nhttp://www.spoj.pl/problems/classical/\nJust select a problem and then start cracking on it.

  <div class="post-content"><p>So today at 8-12PM I had a great session with two friends of mine. It was awesome. Like a mini code retreat.</p>
<p>We set down in a musky bar, drank wine and beer and cider, and decided to practice some TDD with the well known problem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life" target="_blank">Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life</a>. This challenge is really interesting. I never done it before, ever. So it was a really good practice for me.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p><strong>In the beginning there was Test</strong></p>

<p>So this went on and on and I created one test after another while my other coding friend did the same.</p>
