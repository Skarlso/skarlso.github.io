                <p>So today at 8-12PM I had a great session with two friends of mine. It was awesome. Like a mini code retreat.</p>
<p>We set down in a musky bar, drank wine and beer and cider, and decided to practice some TDD with the well known problem of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conway’s Game of Life<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. This challenge is really interesting. I never done it before, ever. So it was a really good practice for me.</p>
<p>So…</p>
<p><strong>In the beginning there was Test</strong></p>
<p>One of my friends and I started out by developing the implementation for the game while the second one was mentoring and couching us. As with any problem I’m facing now days, I started with writing a failing test first. I didn’t write any kind of production code yet. I wrote a test testing for having the class called game of life.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>  &lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
    &lt;pre class=&quot;java&quot; style=&quot;font-family:monospace;&quot;&gt;    @Test
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000066; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; shouldHaveClassForGameOfLife&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#40;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#41;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;
    GameOfLife gameOfLife &lt;span style=&quot;color: #339933;&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; GameOfLife&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#40;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#41;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #339933;&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This wasn’t compiling of course because I didn’t have any kind of GameOfLife class. But intelliJ is so intelligent that I simply pressed Alt+Enter and created the class immediately. The class didn’t have anything in it, but I already had a passing test.</p>
<p>So this went on and on and I created one test after another while my other coding friend did the same.</p>
<p><strong>Now the amazing part</strong></p>
<p>I begun working on the Grid. A simple octagonal coordinating system. This was represented in the beginning with a simple two dimensional array with Cells in it.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre><code>  &lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt;
    &lt;pre class=&quot;java&quot; style=&quot;font-family:monospace;&quot;&gt;    Cells&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt; cells &lt;span style=&quot;color: #339933;&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Cells&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc66cc;&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#91;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #cc66cc;&quot;&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#93;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #339933;&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  &lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
</code></pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>This of course wasn’t dynamic. I didn’t care about that yet. I had my grid of cells. These cells were initially all dead.</p>
<p>Now, the interesting part is that as I developed my Grid finding out the Cells neighbours and counting them, my friend worked on the Cells themselves and getting their next state and killing them based on the rules.</p>
<p>We never talked to each other, didn’t agree on roles or directions or anything. And even so at the and… We were at a stage where we met in the middle and could merge our codes! Our little game of life evolved with a push of a button. ( Three actually. )</p>
<p>This was simply amazing. Without ever talking about the direction we want to go we created a working code base that could be merged!</p>
<p><strong>It just works</strong></p>
<p>Before TDD I would have tackled this problem much differently. And it would have taken me much more time too. This was like an hour or so.</p>
<p>TDD helped me break down the job into small, manageable tasks. I created and deleted and rewrote tests as I went on and on and developed the algorithm for my Grid and Cell. And eventually the problem slowly unfolded itself right before my eyes. I began to see the connections. I began to see the beauty. I began to understand! This is something I rarely enjoyed previously without using TDD.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>I recommend for you guys to do the same. Just sit down, find a problem, find a coding kata and just do it with TDD. With PROPER TDD.</p>
<p>Here are some good sites for katas and problems:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/">http://codekata.pragprog.com/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.spoj.pl/problems/classical/">http://www.spoj.pl/problems/classical/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Just select a problem and then start cracking on it. Do this every time you have some free time. Like a martial art trainee doing basic exercises and you will get better at problem solving and at TDD too. I promise.</p>
<p>Happy coding and good night!</p>
