Like Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. What makes your code understandable to others.\nIs it Comments?\nNo. It’s not comments. If your code could be read properly you wouldn’t need comments to explain what it does. Like Uncle Bob said. A good code doesn’t contain surprises. It does exactly what you would think it should do on the next line. It doesn’t have curves and misinformation. It doesn’t have plots and turns of events like a good crime book. No. Good code is a like a boring soap opera with predictable plot and boring plain characters who don’t change there behavior based on circumstances.\nGood code is easy to read. It flows like the river, falls like a waterfall, cooks like bacon and crosses the road like a professional chicken. If I read line A the next line should be B. If it is a Z or a :@L$. I wont be happy.\nSo then what makes it understandable?\nOn simple word: Readability.\nWhat makes it readable?\nSmall chunks of functions that have descriptive names as few parameters as possible and do only ONE thing at a time. Of course this is not all there is. However it’s the best thing to begin with. A function called “doStuff” that has a complexity of 300 has three fors, two switches and a dozen ifs isn’t really helping. Now if you look at doStuff and try to give a name based on the job of the function and come up with “propageXWithFiveUnlessYEqualsTheSumOfZPlusW” you will know it does more then one thing.\nIf you see a really complex function in your production code or hobby code ask yourself: “Should this really be like 300 lines long and with a complexity of 200??” And as you speak this out loud you will know the answer already. Break it up. Have like a dozen smaller functions that will be better I promise you. Take out parts. Write unit tests to it that help with re-factoring. Break it down into as small chunks as possible. It will be worth it. It will increase understand-ability, readability and maintainability.\nHope that helped.\nThank you for reading and as always,\nHave a nice Day,\nGergely.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><p>Hi!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen this many times over and over again. Many people have wrote books about it already. Like Uncle Bob&rsquo;s Clean Code. Like Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. What makes your code understandable to others.</p>
<p>Is it <strong>Comments</strong>?</p>
<p>No. It&rsquo;s not comments. If your code could be read properly you wouldn&rsquo;t need comments to explain what it does. Like Uncle Bob said. A good code doesn&rsquo;t contain surprises. It does exactly what you would think it should do on the next line. It doesn&rsquo;t have curves and misinformation. It doesn&rsquo;t have plots and turns of events like a good crime book. No. Good code is a like a boring soap opera with predictable plot and boring plain characters who don&rsquo;t change there behavior based on circumstances.</p>
<p>Good code is easy to read. It flows like the river, falls like a waterfall, cooks like bacon and crosses the road like a professional chicken. If I read line A the next line should be B. If it is a Z or a :@L$. I wont be happy.</p>
<p>So then what makes it understandable?</p>
<p>On simple word: <strong>Readability</strong>.</p>
<p>What makes it readable?</p>
<p>Small chunks of functions that have descriptive names as few parameters as possible and do only ONE thing at a time. Of course this is not all there is. However it&rsquo;s the best thing to begin with. A function called &ldquo;doStuff&rdquo; that has a complexity of 300 has three fors, two switches and a dozen ifs isn&rsquo;t really helping. Now if you look at doStuff and try to give a name based on the job of the function and come up with &ldquo;propageXWithFiveUnlessYEqualsTheSumOfZPlusW&rdquo; you will know it does more then one thing.</p>
<p>If you see a really complex function in your production code or hobby code ask yourself: &ldquo;Should this really be like 300 lines long and with a complexity of 200??&rdquo; And as you speak this out loud you will know the answer already. Break it up. Have like a dozen smaller functions that will be better I promise you. Take out parts. Write unit tests to it that help with re-factoring. Break it down into as small chunks as possible. It will be worth it. It will increase understand-ability, readability and maintainability.</p>
<p>Hope that helped.</p>
