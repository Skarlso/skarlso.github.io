However, there are only a few actually describing how to learn something as complicated and logical as programming. How do you draw up a function? How do you draw up a cycle or a structure?\nActually these are really easy. A cycle? No problem. Whatâ€™s a circle if not a cycle? Structure? This should be an easy one. You can draw a whole building and then place building blocks into it.\nI have a very strong visual mind. I donâ€™t remember names good for example however I remember every and each face very distinct. So if you come up to me, donâ€™t be surprised if I donâ€™t remember your name. So as I grew older and I took learning into my own hand I realised that there are techniques out there that I could have used to boost my learning in the early stages of my life too.\nBut there is no such thing as to be late for something. Life is constant learning. So donâ€™t hesitate to start learning something.\nI started to learn Scala for example and I was brainstorming as how to draw up a good map for some programming practices. Brainstorming can help you coming up with something that can display your idea. Try to brainstorm in words only rather then sentences.\nAnd I came up with these two for now, with the play framework in the middle.\n![Structure]1\n![Route]2\nNow some of you might say this took long and is unnecessary. The information displayed can be remembered easily and that these drawings took longer then writing up two or three words. Now letâ€™s see.\nThese drawing, which are really rough actually, took me about 10 minutes while reading and learning and what not. Yes they take longer. But if I write down two words how long will I remember them? I already forgot after I wrote it down!\nThis drawing with the griffon legs? Stuck there forever. ( Donâ€™t ask about the legs.. donâ€™t know where they came from. )\nSo visualisation goes a long way in your brain if you are wired that way. Remember that there is NOTHING that you canâ€™t display with a little bit of creativity and graphics.\nOhh and btw. Chances are that you only read the words in BOLD because your mind draws your attention to parts that stand out. And also you want to get over reading this article fast and you appreciate if key elements are taken out for you without the unimportant gibberish in between. ðŸ˜‰\nThanks for reading!\nGergely.\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/7604030/structure.pngÂ â†©ï¸Ž\nhttp://dl.dropbox.com/u/7604030/route.jpgÂ â†©ï¸Ž\n",
