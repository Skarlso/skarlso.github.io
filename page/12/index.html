                    Hello.
Today I would like to write about something very interesting to you folks.
It’s a common remember / recall technique called the Method of loci. Otherwise known as the Memory Palace. A very popular usage can be seen in the episodes of Sherlock Holmes from BBC. He uses it often.
What is the Method of loci?
As the Wikipedia page write so properly…”In basic terms, it is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information.

So Vim is a very powerful editing tool and has lots and lots of potential in regarding plug-ins.
It has years and years of gathered knowledge and extensions and can virtually do anything you want. But that’s not even it’s final form…
The real power of Vim lies in navigation and manipulation. The ability to navigate and edit without the use of arrow keys or mouse chops of a large portion of your time which you didn’t even realize you are wasting until you try it without it.

I’d like to explain a lot about a topic that is very near my heart. If your job is in an office you will understand this.
Why offices?
So why are we sitting together in one big place cramped up with 20-300 other people? Why bother the catering and the ventilation and what not to accommodate these people at one place? Why not just leave them be and let them work at home?

So why is it a problem that in a requirement from a developer there a lots of these:

– Ranorex
– Eclipse ( yes I saw a few of these… )
– Hibernate
– Grails
– Ruby on Rails

Today I would like to talk to you about something interesting I was talking about with a developer friend.
We talked about the quality of test code.
He said… And I will quote this…”Why should we care? It’s not production code. We aren’t giving it to the customer.”
There are a few reasons why you are going to get a slap in the face for a sentence like this.

Dear everbody.
I’d like to present you a small idea I was working on recently. The reminiscence of an old program. From the view point of the program.
I’m planning to put these out in few days successions.
I hope you enjoy it.
Cheers,
Gergely.

The Past

So without any further ado here it is… The wordpress blog entry submitter plugin for sublime text: Sublime WordPress PluginPlease enjoy.

                    Hey folks.
I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day.
If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It’s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know… It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.
