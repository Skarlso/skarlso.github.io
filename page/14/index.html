                    Hi folks.
Today I want to write to you about learning something with a visual mind. There are a gazillion posts out there that tell you how to learn something with a visual mind. However, there are only a few actually describing how to learn something as complicated and logical as programming. How do you draw up a function? How do you draw up a cycle or a structure?
Actually these are really easy.

                    So today at 8-12PM I had a great session with two friends of mine. It was awesome. Like a mini code retreat.
We set down in a musky bar, drank wine and beer and cider, and decided to practice some TDD with the well known problem of Conway’s Game of Life. This challenge is really interesting. I never done it before, ever. So it was a really good practice for me.

Today I want to talk to you about.. Well.. How to read a professional book for slow learners without too much waste of time.
Let us start at the… well… the beginning. How do you normally read a book if you want to memorize it properly. You read it once and then re read the whole thing again until it gets in your head? Or do you have another strategy?

Throwing Exceptions. That is in your method you have something like this:
 &lt;td class=&quot;code&quot;&gt; &lt;pre class=&quot;java&quot; style=&quot;font-family:monospace;&quot;&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000066; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; insertMethodNameHere&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#40;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #003399;&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; param&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#41;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #000000; font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;throws&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #003399;&quot;&gt;Exception&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#123;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #009900;&quot;&gt;&amp;#125;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;  This is bad.

I want to write a little bit about writing a professional blog.
Early steps
Let’s first talk about what you understand about professional blog. It’s either a semi professional one, that mixes life with professionalism, like chess, programming, testing, painting, drawing, engineering whatever your profession is. Or it can be a purely professional one without your life getting involved in it.
Either way you have to decide at the beginning.

I’ve seen this many times over and over again. Many people have wrote books about it already. Like Uncle Bob’s Clean Code. Like Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. What makes your code understandable to others.
Is it Comments?
No. It’s not comments. If your code could be read properly you wouldn’t need comments to explain what it does. Like Uncle Bob said. A good code doesn’t contain surprises.

Today I want to talk about a little adventure I had yesterday night. It was quite the fun and frustration too. But neither comes without the other when it’s about linux.
So let us see what the problem is at hand. The problem machine is a Dell Inspiron N5110 with Nvidia card number one: GeForce GT 525M. And number two: Integrated. Optimus for the win.
So how windows is handling this is actually with a software called Optimus.
