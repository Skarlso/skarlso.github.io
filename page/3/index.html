<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>A while ago, I was added as a curator for a Gem called <a href="https://github.com/joshbuddy/jsonpath">JsonPath</a>. It&rsquo;s a small but very useful and brilliant gem. It had a couple of problems which I fixed, but the hardest to eliminate proved to be a series of evals throughout the code.</p>

<p>You could opt in using <code>eval</code> with a constructor parameter, but generally, it was considered to be unsafe. Thus, normally when a project was using it, like <a href="https://github.com/huginn/huginn">Huginn</a> they had to opt out by default, thus missing out on sweet parsing like this: <code>$..book[?(@['price'] &gt; 20)]</code>.</p>

<h2 id="eval">Eval</h2>

<p>In order to remove eval, first I had to understand what it is actually doing. I had to take it apart.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/takeevalapart.jpg" alt="apart" /></p>

<p>After much digging and understanding the code, I found, all it does is perform the given operations on the current node. And if the operation is true, it will select that node, otherwise, return false, and ignore that node.</p>

<p>For example <code>$..book[?(@['price'] &gt; 20)]</code> could be translated to:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">return @_current_node['price'] &gt; 20
</code></pre>

<p>Checking first if <code>'price'</code> is even a key in <code>@_current_node</code>. Once I&rsquo;ve understood this part, I set on trying to fix eval.</p>

<h3 id="safe-4">SAFE = 4</h3>

<p>In ruby, you could extract the part where you Eval and put it into its own proc and set <code>SAFE = 4</code> which will disable some things like system calls.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">proc do
  SAFE = 4
  eval(some_expression)
end.call
</code></pre>

<p>SAFE levels:</p>

<p>$SAFE   Description
0   No checking of the use of externally supplied (tainted) data is performed. This is Ruby&rsquo;s default mode.
&gt;= 1    Ruby disallows the use of tainted data by potentially dangerous operations.
&gt;= 2    Ruby prohibits the loading of program files from globally writable locations.
&gt;= 3    All newly created objects are considered tainted.
&gt;= 4    Ruby effectively partitions the running program in two. None - tainted objects may not be modified. Typically, this will be used to create a sandbox: the program sets up an environment using a lower $SAFE level, then resets $SAFE to 4 to prevent subsequent changes to that environment.</p>

<p>This has the disadvantage that anything below 4 is just, meh. But nothing above 1 will actually work with JsonPath so&hellip; scratch that.</p>

<h3 id="sandboxing">Sandboxing</h3>

<p>We could technically try and sandbox eval into it&rsquo;s own process with a PID and whitelist methods which are allowed to be called.</p>

<p>Not bad, and there are a few gems out there which are trying to do that like <a href="https://github.com/ukutaht/safe_ruby">SafeRuby</a>. But all of these project have been abandoned years ago for a good reason.</p>

<h3 id="object-send">Object.send</h3>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/nobodylikesyou.jpg" alt="nobodylikesyou" /></p>

<p><code>Object.send</code> is the best way to get some flexibility while still being safe. You basically just call methods on objects by describing said method on an object and giving parameters to it, like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">1.send(:+, 2) =&gt; 3
</code></pre>

<p>This is a very powerful tool in our toolbox which we will exploit immensely.</p>

<p>So let&rsquo;s get to it.</p>

<h1 id="writing-a-parser">Writing a parser</h1>

<p>Writing a parser in Ruby is a very fluid experience. It has nice tools which support that, and the one I used is <code>StringScanner</code>. It has the ability to track where you are currently at in a string and move a pointer along with regex matches. In fact, JsonPath already employs this method when parsing a json expression. So reusing that logic was in fact&hellip; elementary.</p>

<h2 id="the-expression">The expression</h2>

<p>How do we get from this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">$..book[?(@['price'] &lt; 20)]
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">@_current_node['price'] &lt; 20
</code></pre>

<p>Well. By simple elimination. There are a couple of problems along the way of course. Because this wouldn&rsquo;t be a parser if it couldn&rsquo;t handle ALL the other cases&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="removing-clutter">Removing Clutter</h3>

<p>Some of this we don&rsquo;t need. Like, <code>$..book</code> part.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/dontneed1.jpg" alt="dontneed1" /></p>

<p>The other things we don&rsquo;t need are all the <code>'[]?()</code></p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/dontneed2.jpg" alt="dontneed2" /></p>

<p>Once this is done, we can move to isolating the important bits.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/takingaim.jpg" alt="takingaim" /></p>

<h3 id="breakdown">BreakDown</h3>

<h4 id="elements">Elements</h4>

<p>How does an expression actually look like?</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s break it down.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/confused.jpg" alt="confused" /></p>

<p>So, this is a handful. Operations can be <code>&lt;=,&gt;=,&lt;,&gt;,==,!=</code> and operands can be either numbers, or words, and element accessor can be nested since something like this is perfectly valid: <code>$..book[?(@.written.year == 1997)]</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/feedline.jpg" alt="feedline" /></p>

<p>To avoid being overwhelmed, ruby has our back with a method called <code>dig</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/dig.jpg" alt="dig" /></p>

<p>This, basically lets us pass in some parameters into a dig function on a hash or an array with variadic parameters, which will go on and access those elements in order how they were supplied. Until it either returns a <code>nil</code> or an end result.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">2.3.1 :001 &gt; a = {a: {b: 'c'}}
 =&gt; {:a=&gt;{:b=&gt;&quot;c&quot;}}
2.3.1 :002 &gt; a.dig(:a, :b)
 =&gt; &quot;c&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>Easy. However&hellip; Dig was only added after ruby 2.3 thus, I had to write my own dig for now, until I stop supporting anything below 2.3.</p>

<p>At first, I wanted to add it to the hash class, but it proved to be a futile attempt if I wanted to do it nicely, thus the parser got it as a private method.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">    def dig(keys, hash)
      return hash unless hash.is_a? Hash
      return nil unless hash.key?(keys.first)
      return hash.fetch(keys.first) if keys.size == 1
      prev = keys.shift
      dig(keys, hash.fetch(prev))
    end
</code></pre>

<p>And the corresponding regex behind getting a multitude of elements is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">...
if t = scanner.scan(/\['\w+'\]+/)
...
</code></pre>

<h4 id="operator">Operator</h4>

<p>Selecting the operator is another interesting part as it can be a single one or multiple and all sorts. Until I realized that no&hellip; it can actually be only a couple.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/whatone.jpg" alt="whatone" /></p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/whattwo.jpg" alt="whattwo" /></p>

<p>Also, after a bit of fiddling and doing and doing a silly case statement first:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">case op
when '&gt;'
  dig(@_current_node, *elements) &gt; operand
when '&lt;'
  dig(@_current_node, *elements) &gt; operand
...
end
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;I promptly saw that this is not how it should be done.</p>

<p>And here comes Object.send.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/send.jpg" alt="send" /></p>

<p>This gave me the opportunity to write this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">dig(elements, @_current_node).send(operator, operand)
</code></pre>

<p>Much better. Now I could send all the things in the way of a node.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/sendtwo.jpg" alt="send" /></p>

<p>Parsing an op be like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">elsif t = scanner.scan(/\s+[&lt;&gt;=][&lt;&gt;=]?\s+?/)
</code></pre>

<h4 id="operand">Operand</h4>

<p>Now comes the final piece. The value which we are comparing. This could either be a simple integer, a floating number, or a word. Hah. So coming up with a regex which fits this tightly took a little fiddling, but eventually I ended up with this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">elsif t = scanner.scan(/(\s+)?'?(\w+)?[.,]?(\w+)?'?(\s+)?/)
</code></pre>

<p>Without StackOverflow I would say this is fine ((although I need to remove all those space check, shees)). What are all the question marks? Basically, everything is optional. Because an this expression <code>$..book[?(@.price)]</code> is valid. Which is basically just asserting if a given node has a price element.</p>

<h4 id="logical-operators">Logical Operators</h4>

<p>The last thing that remains is logical operators, which if you are using eval, is pretty straight forward. It takes care of anything that you might add in like <code>&amp;&amp;, ||, |, &amp;, ^</code> etc etc.</p>

<p>Now, that&rsquo;s something I did with a case though. Until I find a nicer solution. Since we can already parse a single expression it&rsquo;s just a question of breaking down a multi structure expression as the following one: <code>$..book[?(@['price'] &gt; 20 &amp;&amp; @.written.year == 1998)]</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">exps = exp.split(/(&amp;&amp;)|(\|\|)/)
</code></pre>

<p>This splits up the string by either <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> and the usage of groups () also includes the operators. Than I evaluate the expressions and save the whole thing in an array like <code>[true, '&amp;&amp;', false]</code>. You know what could immediately resolve this? Yep&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/saynotoeval.jpg" alt="saynotoeval" />.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d rather just parse it although technically an eval at this stage wouldn&rsquo;t be that big of a problem&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def parse(exp)
  exps = exp.split(/(&amp;&amp;)|(\|\|)/)
  ret = parse_exp(exps.shift)
  exps.each_with_index do |item, index|
    case item
    when '&amp;&amp;'
      ret &amp;&amp;= parse_exp(exps[index + 1])
    when '||'
      ret ||= parse_exp(exps[index + 1])
    end
  end
  ret
end
</code></pre>

<h1 id="closing-words">Closing words</h1>

<p>That&rsquo;s it folks. The parser is done. And there is no eval being used. There are some more things here that are interesting. Like, array indexing is allowed in jsonpath which is solved by sending <code>.length</code> to a current node. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">if scanner.scan(/\./)
  sym = scanner.scan(/\w+/)
  op = scanner.scan(/./)
  num = scanner.scan(/\d+/)
  return @_current_node.send(sym.to_sym).send(op.to_sym, num.to_i)
end
</code></pre>

<p>If an expression begins with a <code>.</code>. So you see that using <code>send</code> will help a lot, and understanding what eval is trying to evaluate and rather writing your own parser, isn&rsquo;t that hard at all using ruby.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this little tid-bit as much as I enjoyed writing and drawing it. Leave a comment if your liked the drawings or if you did not and I should never do them again (( I don&rsquo;t really care, this is my blog haha. )). Note to self: I shouldn&rsquo;t draw on the other side of the drawing because of bleed-through.</p>

<p>Thank you!
Gergely.</p>

      return hash unless hash.is_a? Hash
      return nil unless hash.key?(keys.first)
      return hash.fetch(keys.first) if keys.size == 1
      prev = keys.shift
      dig(keys, hash.fetch(prev))
    end
</code></pre>

<p>And the corresponding regex behind getting a multitude of elements is as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">...
if t = scanner.scan(/\['\w+'\]+/)
...
</code></pre>

<h4 id="operator">Operator</h4>

<p>Selecting the operator is another interesting part as it can be a single one or multiple and all sorts. Until I realized that no&hellip; it can actually be only a couple.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/whatone.jpg" alt="whatone" /></p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/whattwo.jpg" alt="whattwo" /></p>

<p>Also, after a bit of fiddling and doing and doing a silly case statement first:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">case op
when '&gt;'
  dig(@_current_node, *elements) &gt; operand
when '&lt;'
  dig(@_current_node, *elements) &gt; operand
...
end
</code></pre>

<p>&hellip;I promptly saw that this is not how it should be done.</p>

<p>And here comes Object.send.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/send.jpg" alt="send" /></p>

<p>This gave me the opportunity to write this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">dig(elements, @_current_node).send(operator, operand)
</code></pre>

<p>Much better. Now I could send all the things in the way of a node.</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/sendtwo.jpg" alt="send" /></p>

<p>Parsing an op be like:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">elsif t = scanner.scan(/\s+[&lt;&gt;=][&lt;&gt;=]?\s+?/)
</code></pre>

<h4 id="operand">Operand</h4>

<p>Now comes the final piece. The value which we are comparing. This could either be a simple integer, a floating number, or a word. Hah. So coming up with a regex which fits this tightly took a little fiddling, but eventually I ended up with this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">elsif t = scanner.scan(/(\s+)?'?(\w+)?[.,]?(\w+)?'?(\s+)?/)
</code></pre>

<p>Without StackOverflow I would say this is fine ((although I need to remove all those space check, shees)). What are all the question marks? Basically, everything is optional. Because an this expression <code>$..book[?(@.price)]</code> is valid. Which is basically just asserting if a given node has a price element.</p>

<h4 id="logical-operators">Logical Operators</h4>

<p>The last thing that remains is logical operators, which if you are using eval, is pretty straight forward. It takes care of anything that you might add in like <code>&amp;&amp;, ||, |, &amp;, ^</code> etc etc.</p>

<p>Now, that&rsquo;s something I did with a case though. Until I find a nicer solution. Since we can already parse a single expression it&rsquo;s just a question of breaking down a multi structure expression as the following one: <code>$..book[?(@['price'] &gt; 20 &amp;&amp; @.written.year == 1998)]</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">exps = exp.split(/(&amp;&amp;)|(\|\|)/)
</code></pre>

<p>This splits up the string by either <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> and the usage of groups () also includes the operators. Than I evaluate the expressions and save the whole thing in an array like <code>[true, '&amp;&amp;', false]</code>. You know what could immediately resolve this? Yep&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="https://skarlso.github.io/img/saynotoeval.jpg" alt="saynotoeval" />.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d rather just parse it although technically an eval at this stage wouldn&rsquo;t be that big of a problem&hellip;</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">def parse(exp)
  exps = exp.split(/(&amp;&amp;)|(\|\|)/)
  ret = parse_exp(exps.shift)
  exps.each_with_index do |item, index|
    case item
    when '&amp;&amp;'
      ret &amp;&amp;= parse_exp(exps[index + 1])
    when '||'
      ret ||= parse_exp(exps[index + 1])
    end
  end
  ret
end
</code></pre>

<h1 id="closing-words">Closing words</h1>

<p>That&rsquo;s it folks. The parser is done. And there is no eval being used. There are some more things here that are interesting. Like, array indexing is allowed in jsonpath which is solved by sending <code>.length</code> to a current node. For example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-ruby">if scanner.scan(/\./)
  sym = scanner.scan(/\w+/)
  op = scanner.scan(/./)
  num = scanner.scan(/\d+/)
  return @_current_node.send(sym.to_sym).send(op.to_sym, num.to_i)
end
</code></pre>

<p>If an expression begins with a <code>.</code>. So you see that using <code>send</code> will help a lot, and understanding what eval is trying to evaluate and rather writing your own parser, isn&rsquo;t that hard at all using ruby.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this little tid-bit as much as I enjoyed writing and drawing it. Leave a comment if your liked the drawings or if you did not and I should never do them again (( I don&rsquo;t really care, this is my blog haha. )). Note to self: I shouldn&rsquo;t draw on the other side of the drawing because of bleed-through.</p>

<p>Thank you!
Gergely.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Previously on this blog: <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/16/building-furnace-part-1/">Part 1</a>. <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/19/building-furnace-part-2/">Part 2</a>. <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/22/building-furnace-part-3/">Part 3</a>.</p>

<p>In this part we are going to talk about Unit Testing Furnace and how to work some magic with AWS and Go.</p>

<h1 id="mock-stub-fake-dummy-canned-insert-name-here">Mock Stub Fake Dummy Canned <Insert Name Here></h1>

<p>Unit testing in Go usually follows the Dependency Injection model of dealing with Mocks and Stubs.</p>

<p>## DI</p>

<p>Dependency Inject in short is one object supplying the dependencies of another object. In a longer description, it&rsquo;s ideal to be used
for removing the lock on a third party library, like the AWS client. Imaging having code which solely depends on the AWS client. How
would you unit test that code without having to ACTUALLY connect to AWS? You couldn&rsquo;t. Every time you try to test the code it would run
the live code and it would try and connect to AWS and perform the operations it&rsquo;s design to do. The Ruby library with it&rsquo;s metaprogramming
allows you to set the client globally to stub responses, but, alas, this is not the world of Ruby.</p>

<p>Here is where DI comes to the rescue. If you have control over the AWS client on a very high level, and would pass it around as a function
parameter, or create that client in an <code>init()</code> function and have it globally defined; you would be able to implement your own client, and
have your code use that with stubbed responses which your tests need. For example, you would like a CreateApplication call to fail, or you
would like a DescribeStack which returns an aws.Error(&ldquo;StackAlreadyExists&rdquo;).</p>

<p>For this, however, you need the API of the AWS client. Which is provided by AWS.</p>

<h2 id="aws-client-api">AWS Client API</h2>

<p>In order for DI to work, the injected object needs to be of a certain type for us to inject our own. Luckily, AWS provides an Interface for
all of it&rsquo;s clients. Meaning, we can implement our own version for all of the clients, like S3, CloudFormation, CodeDeploy etc.</p>

<p>For each client you want to mock out, an <em>*iface</em> package should be present like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">  &quot;github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/service/cloudformation/cloudformationiface&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>In this package you find and use the interface like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">type fakeCloudFormationClient struct {
	cloudformationiface.CloudFormationAPI
	err error
}
</code></pre>

<p>And with this, we have our own CloudFormation client. The real code uses the real clients as function parameters, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// Execute defines what this command does.
func (c *Create) Execute(opts *commander.CommandHelper) {
	log.Println(&quot;Creating cloud formation session.&quot;)
	sess := session.New(&amp;aws.Config{Region: aws.String(config.REGION)})
	cfClient := cloudformation.New(sess, nil)
	client := CFClient{cfClient}
	createExecute(opts, &amp;client)
}
</code></pre>

<p>We can&rsquo;t test Execute itself, as it&rsquo;s using the real client here (or you could have a global from some library, thus allowing you to tests
even <code>Execute</code> here) but there is very little logic in this function for this very reason. All the logic is in small functions for which
the main starting point and our testing opportunity is, <code>createExecute</code>.</p>

<h2 id="stubbing-calls">Stubbing Calls</h2>

<p>Now, that we have our own client, and with the power of Go&rsquo;s interface embedding as seen above with CloudFormationAPI, we have to only stub
the functions which we are actually using, instead of every function of the given interface. This looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	cfClient := new(CFClient)
	cfClient.Client = &amp;fakeCloudFormationClient{err: nil}
</code></pre>

<p>Where cfClient is a struct like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// CFClient abstraction for cloudFormation client.
type CFClient struct {
	Client cloudformationiface.CloudFormationAPI
}
</code></pre>

<p>And a stubbed call can than be written as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func (fc *fakeCreateCFClient) WaitUntilStackCreateComplete(input *cloudformation.DescribeStacksInput) error {
	return nil
}
</code></pre>

<p>This can range from a very trivial example, like the one above, to intricate ones as well, like this gem:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func (fc *fakePushCFClient) ListStackResources(input *cloudformation.ListStackResourcesInput) (*cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput, error) {
	if &quot;NoASG&quot; == *input.StackName {
		return &amp;cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput{
			StackResourceSummaries: []*cloudformation.StackResourceSummary{
				{
					ResourceType:       aws.String(&quot;NoASG&quot;),
					PhysicalResourceId: aws.String(&quot;arn::whatever&quot;),
				},
			},
		}, fc.err
	}
	return &amp;cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput{
		StackResourceSummaries: []*cloudformation.StackResourceSummary{
			{
				ResourceType:       aws.String(&quot;AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup&quot;),
				PhysicalResourceId: aws.String(&quot;arn::whatever&quot;),
			},
		},
	}, fc.err
}
</code></pre>

<p>This ListStackResources stub lets us test two scenarios based on the stackname. If the test stackname is &lsquo;NoASG&rsquo; it will return a result
which equals to a result containing no AutoScaling Group. Otherwise, it will return the correct ResourceType for an ASG.</p>

<p>It is a common practice to line up several scenario based stubbed responses in order to test the robustness of your code.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this also means that your tests will be a bit cluttered with stubs and mock structs and whatnots. For that, I&rsquo;m partially
using a package available struct file in which I&rsquo;m defining most of the mock structs at least. And from there on, the tests will only contain
specific stubs for that particular file. This can be further fine grained by having defaults and than only override in case you need something
else.</p>

<h1 id="testing-fatals">Testing fatals</h1>

<p>Now, the other point which is not really AWS related, but still comes to mind when dealing with Furnace, is testing error scenarios.</p>

<p>Because Furnace is a CLI application it uses Fatals to signal if something is wrong and it doesn&rsquo;t want to continue or recover because, frankly
it can&rsquo;t. If AWS throws an error, that&rsquo;s it. You can retry, but in 90% of the cases, it&rsquo;s usually something that you messed up.</p>

<p>So, how do we test for a fatal or an <code>os.Exit</code>? There are a number of points on that if you do a quick search. You may end up on this talk:
<a href="https://talks.golang.org/2014/testing.slide#23">GoTalk 2014 Testing Slide #23</a>. Which does an interesting thing. It calls the test binary in a
separate process and tests the exit code.</p>

<p>Others, and me as well, will say that you have to have your own logger implemented and use a different logger / os.Exit in your test environment.</p>

<p>Others others will tell you to not to have tests around os.Exit and fatal things, rather return an error and only the main should pop a world
ending event. I leave it up to you which you want to use. Either is fine.</p>

<p>In Furnace, I&rsquo;m using a global logger in my error handling util like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// HandleFatal handler fatal errors in Furnace.
func HandleFatal(s string, err error) {
	LogFatalf(s, err)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>LogFatalf</code> is an exported variable <code>var LogFatalf = log.Fatalf</code>. Than in a test, I just override this variable with a local anonymous
function:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func TestCreateExecuteEmptyStack(t *testing.T) {
	failed := false
	utils.LogFatalf = func(s string, a ...interface{}) {
		failed = true
	}
	config.WAITFREQUENCY = 0
	client := new(CFClient)
	stackname := &quot;EmptyStack&quot;
	client.Client = &amp;fakeCreateCFClient{err: nil, stackname: stackname}
	opts := &amp;commander.CommandHelper{}
	createExecute(opts, client)
	if !failed {
		t.Error(&quot;expected outcome to fail during create&quot;)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>It can get even more granular by testing for the error message to make sure that it actually fails at the point we think we are
testing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func TestCreateStackReturnsWithError(t *testing.T) {
	failed := false
	expectedMessage := &quot;failed to create stack&quot;
	var message string
	utils.LogFatalf = func(s string, a ...interface{}) {
		failed = true
		if err, ok := a[0].(error); ok {
			message = err.Error()
		}
	}
	config.WAITFREQUENCY = 0
	client := new(CFClient)
	stackname := &quot;NotEmptyStack&quot;
	client.Client = &amp;fakeCreateCFClient{err: errors.New(expectedMessage), stackname: stackname}
	config := []byte(&quot;{}&quot;)
	create(stackname, config, client)
	if !failed {
		t.Error(&quot;expected outcome to fail&quot;)
	}
	if message != expectedMessage {
		t.Errorf(&quot;message did not equal expected message of '%s', was:%s&quot;, expectedMessage, message)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This is it. That&rsquo;s all it took to write Furnace. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing all these thoughts down.</p>

<p>I hope somebody might learn from my journey and also improve upon it.</p>

<p>Any comments are much appreciated and welcomed. Also, PRs and Issues can be submitted on the GitHub page of <a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/go-furnace">Furnace</a>.</p>

separate process and tests the exit code.</p>

<p>Others, and me as well, will say that you have to have your own logger implemented and use a different logger / os.Exit in your test environment.</p>

<p>Others others will tell you to not to have tests around os.Exit and fatal things, rather return an error and only the main should pop a world
ending event. I leave it up to you which you want to use. Either is fine.</p>

<p>In Furnace, I&rsquo;m using a global logger in my error handling util like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// HandleFatal handler fatal errors in Furnace.
func HandleFatal(s string, err error) {
	LogFatalf(s, err)
}
</code></pre>

<p>And <code>LogFatalf</code> is an exported variable <code>var LogFatalf = log.Fatalf</code>. Than in a test, I just override this variable with a local anonymous
function:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func TestCreateExecuteEmptyStack(t *testing.T) {
	failed := false
	utils.LogFatalf = func(s string, a ...interface{}) {
		failed = true
	}
	config.WAITFREQUENCY = 0
	client := new(CFClient)
	stackname := &quot;EmptyStack&quot;
	client.Client = &amp;fakeCreateCFClient{err: nil, stackname: stackname}
	opts := &amp;commander.CommandHelper{}
	createExecute(opts, client)
	if !failed {
		t.Error(&quot;expected outcome to fail during create&quot;)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>It can get even more granular by testing for the error message to make sure that it actually fails at the point we think we are
testing:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">func TestCreateStackReturnsWithError(t *testing.T) {
	failed := false
	expectedMessage := &quot;failed to create stack&quot;
	var message string
	utils.LogFatalf = func(s string, a ...interface{}) {
		failed = true
		if err, ok := a[0].(error); ok {
			message = err.Error()
		}
	}
	config.WAITFREQUENCY = 0
	client := new(CFClient)
	stackname := &quot;NotEmptyStack&quot;
	client.Client = &amp;fakeCreateCFClient{err: errors.New(expectedMessage), stackname: stackname}
	config := []byte(&quot;{}&quot;)
	create(stackname, config, client)
	if !failed {
		t.Error(&quot;expected outcome to fail&quot;)
	}
	if message != expectedMessage {
		t.Errorf(&quot;message did not equal expected message of '%s', was:%s&quot;, expectedMessage, message)
	}
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>

<p>This is it. That&rsquo;s all it took to write Furnace. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing all these thoughts down.</p>

<p>I hope somebody might learn from my journey and also improve upon it.</p>

<p>Any comments are much appreciated and welcomed. Also, PRs and Issues can be submitted on the GitHub page of <a href="https://github.com/Skarlso/go-furnace">Furnace</a>.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Previously on this blog: <a href="http://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/16/building-furnace-part-1/">Part 1</a>. <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/19/building-furnace-part-2/">Part 2</a>. <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/04/16/building-furnace-part-4/">Part 4</a>.</p>

<p>In this part, I&rsquo;m going to talk about the experimental plugin system of Furnace.</p>

<h1 id="go-experimental-plugins">Go Experimental Plugins</h1>

<p>Since Go 1.8 was released, an exciting and new feature was introduced called a Plug-in system. This system works with dynamic
libraries built with a special switch to <code>go build</code>. These libraries, <code>.so</code> or <code>.dylib</code> (later), are than loaded and once that
succeeds, specific functions can be called from them (symbol resolution).</p>

<p>We will see how this works. For package information, visit the plugin packages Go doc page
<a href="https://tip.golang.org/pkg/plugin/">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="furnace-plugins">Furnace Plugins</h1>

<p>So, what does furnace use plugins for? Furnace uses plugins to execute arbitery code in, currently, four given locations / events.</p>

<p>These are: <code>pre_create, post_create, pre_delete, post_delete</code>. These events are called, as their name suggests, before and after
the creation and deletion of the CloudFormation stack. It allows the user to execute some code without having to rebuild the whole
project. It does that by defining a single entry point for the custom code called <code>RunPlugin</code>. Any number of functions can be
implemented, but the plugin MUST provide this single, exported function. Otherwise it will fail and ignore that plugin.</p>

<h2 id="using-plugins">Using Plugins</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s really easy to implement, and use these plugins. I&rsquo;m not going into the detail of how to load them, because that is done by
Furnace, but only how to write and use them.</p>

<p>To use a plugin, create a go file called: <code>0001_mailer.go</code>. The <code>0001</code> before it will define WHEN it&rsquo;s executed.
Having multiple plugins is completely okay. Execution of order however, depends on the names of the files.</p>

<p>Now, in 0001_mailer.post_create we would have something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import &quot;log&quot;

// RunPlugin runs the plugin.
func RunPlugin() {
	log.Println(&quot;My Awesome Pre Create Plugin.&quot;)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next step is the build this file to be a plugin library. Note: Right now, this only works on Linux!</p>

<p>To build this file run the following:</p>

<pre><code>go build -buildmode=plugin -o 0001_mailer.pre_create 0001_mailer.go
</code></pre>

<p>The important part here is the extension of the file specified with <code>-o</code>. It&rsquo;s important because that&rsquo;s how Furnace identifies
what plugins it has to run.</p>

<p>Finally, copy this file to <code>~/.config/go-furnace/plugins</code> and you are all set.</p>

<h2 id="slack-notification-plugin">Slack notification Plugin</h2>

<p>To demonstrate how a plugin could be used is if you need some kind of notification once a Stack is completed. For example, you
might want to send a message to a Slack room. To do this, your plugin would look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">package main

import (
	&quot;fmt&quot;
	&quot;os&quot;

	&quot;github.com/nlopes/slack&quot;
)

func RunPlugin() {
	stackname := os.Getenv(&quot;FURNACE_STACKNAME&quot;)
	api := slack.New(&quot;YOUR_TOKEN_HERE&quot;)
	params := slack.PostMessageParameters{}
	channelID, timestamp, err := api.PostMessage(&quot;#general&quot;, fmt.Sprintf(&quot;Stack with name '%s' is Done.&quot;, stackname), params)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Printf(&quot;%s\n&quot;, err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf(&quot;Message successfully sent to channel %s at %s&quot;, channelID, timestamp)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, Furnace has no ability to share information of the stack with an outside plugin. Thus &lsquo;Done&rsquo; could be anything from
Rollback to Failed to CreateComplete.</p>

<h1 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h1>

<p>That&rsquo;s it for plugins. Thanks very much for reading!

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Previously on this blog: <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/16/building-furnace-part-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/22/building-furnace-part-3/">Part 3</a>, <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/04/16/building-furnace-part-4/">Part 4</a></p>

<p>In this part, I&rsquo;m going to talk about the AWS Go SDK and begin do dissect the intricacies of Furnace.</p>

<h1 id="aws-sdk">AWS SDK</h1>

<p>Fortunately, the Go SDK for AWS is quiet verbose and littered with examples of all sorts. But that doesn&rsquo;t make it less complex
and less cryptic at times. I&rsquo;m here to lift some of the early confusions, in hopes that I can help someone to avoid wasting time.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-and-developers-guide">Getting Started and Developers Guide</h2>

<p>As always, and common from AWS, the documentation is top notch. There is a 141 pages long developer&rsquo;s guide on the SDK containing
a getting started section and an API reference. Go check it out. I&rsquo;ll wait. <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/aws-sdk-go-dg.pdf">AWS Go SDK DG PDF</a>. I will only talk about some gotchas and things I encountered, not the basics of the SDK.</p>

<h2 id="aws-string-and-other-types">aws.String and other types</h2>

<p>Something which is immediately visible once we take a look at the API is that everything is a pointer. Now, there are a
tremendous amount of discussions about this, but I&rsquo;m with Amazon. There are various reasons for it, but to list the most prominent
ones:
    - Type completion and compile time type safety.
    - Values for AWS API calls have valid zero values, in addition to being optional, i.e. not being provided at all.
    - Other option, like, empty interfaces with maps, or using zero values, or struct wrappers around every type, made life much
       harder rather than easier or not possible at all.
    - The AWS API is volatile. You never know when something gets to be optional, or required. Pointers made that decision easy.</p>

<p>There are good number of other discussions around this topic, for example: <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/363">AWS Go GitHub #363</a>.</p>

<p>In order to use primitives, AWS has helper functions like <code>aws.String</code>. Because &amp;&ldquo;asdf&rdquo; is not allowed, you would have to create a
variable and use its address in situations where a string pointer is needed, for example, name of the stack. These primitive helpers will
make in-lining possible. We&rsquo;ll see later that they are used to a great extent. Pointers, however, make life a bit difficult when
constructing Input structs and make for poor aesthetics.</p>

<p>This is something I&rsquo;m returning in a test for stubbing a client call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">		return &amp;cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput{
			StackResourceSummaries: []*cloudformation.StackResourceSummary{
				{
					ResourceType:       aws.String(&quot;NoASG&quot;),
					PhysicalResourceId: aws.String(&quot;arn::whatever&quot;),
				},
			},
		}
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t look so appealing, but one gets used to it quickly.</p>

<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>

<p>Errors also have their own types. An AWS error looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">if err != nil {
    if awsErr, ok := err.(awserr.Error); ok {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>First, we check if error is nil, than we type check if the error is an AWS error or something different. In the wild, this will
look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	if err != nil {
		if awsErr, ok := err.(awserr.Error); ok {
			if awsErr.Code() != codedeploy.ErrCodeDeploymentGroupAlreadyExistsException {
				log.Println(awsErr.Code())
				return err
			}
			log.Println(&quot;DeploymentGroup already exists. Nothing to do.&quot;)
			return nil
		}
		return err
	}
</code></pre>

<p>If it&rsquo;s an AWS error, we can check further for the error code that it returns in order to identify what to handle, or what to throw
on to the caller to a potential fatal. Here, I&rsquo;m ignoring the AlreadyExistsException because, if it does, we just go on to a next
action.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Luckily the API doc is very mature. In most of the cases, they provide an example to an API call. These examples, however, from
time to time provide more confusion than clarity. Take CloudFormation. For me, when I first glanced upon the
description of the API it wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear that the <code>TemplateBody</code> was supposed to be the whole template, and that
the rest of the fields were almost all optional settings. Or provided overrides in special cases.</p>

<p>And since the template is not an ordinary JAML or JSON file, I was looking for something that parses it into that the Struct I
was going to use. After some time, and digging, I realized that I didn&rsquo;t need that, and that I just need to read in the template,
define some extra parameters, and give the TemplateBody the whole of the template. The parameters defined by the CloudFormation
template where extracted for me by <code>ValidateTemplate</code> API call which returned all of them in a convenient
<code>[]*cloudformation.Parameter</code> slice. These things are not described in the document or visible from the examples. I mainly found
them through playing with the API and focused experimentation.</p>

<h2 id="waiters">Waiters</h2>

<p>From other SDK implementations, we got used to Waiters. These handy methods wait for a service to become available or for certain
situations to take in effect, like a Stage being <code>CREATE_COMPLETE</code>. The Go waiters, however, don&rsquo;t allow for callback to be fired,
or for running blocks, like the ruby SDK does. For this, I wrote a handy little waiter for myself, which outputs a spinner to see
that we are currently waiting for something and not frozen in time. This waiter looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// WaitForFunctionWithStatusOutput waits for a function to complete its action.
func WaitForFunctionWithStatusOutput(state string, freq int, f func()) {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)
	done := make(chan bool)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		f()
		done &lt;- true
	}()
	go func() {
		counter := 0
		for {
			counter = (counter + 1) % len(Spinners[config.SPINNER])
			fmt.Printf(&quot;\r[%s] Waiting for state: %s&quot;, yellow(string(Spinners[config.SPINNER][counter])), red(state))
			time.Sleep(time.Duration(freq) * time.Second)
			select {
			case &lt;-done:
				fmt.Println()
				break
			default:
			}
		}
	}()

	wg.Wait()
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I&rsquo;m calling it with the following method:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	utils.WaitForFunctionWithStatusOutput(&quot;DELETE_COMPLETE&quot;, config.WAITFREQUENCY, func() {
		cfClient.Client.WaitUntilStackDeleteComplete(describeStackInput)
	})
</code></pre>

<p>This would output these lines to the console:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">[\] Waiting for state: DELETE_COMPLETE
</code></pre>

<p>The spinner can be configured to be one of the following types:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">var Spinners = []string{`←↖↑↗→↘↓↙`,
	`▁▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃`,
	`┤┘┴└├┌┬┐`,
	`◰◳◲◱`,
	`◴◷◶◵`,
	`◐◓◑◒`,
	`⣾⣽⣻⢿⡿⣟⣯⣷`,
	`|/-\`}
</code></pre>

<p>Handy.</p>

<p>And with that, let&rsquo;s dive into the basics of Furnace.</p>

<h1 id="furnace">Furnace</h1>

<h2 id="directory-structure-and-packages">Directory Structure and Packages</h2>

<p>Furnace is divided into three main packages.</p>

<h3 id="commands">commands</h3>

<p>Commands package is where the gist of Furnace lies. These commands represent the commands which are used through the CLI. Each
file has the implementation for one command. The structure is devised by this library: <a href="https://github.com/Yitsushi/go-commander">Yitsushi&rsquo;s Command Library</a>.
As of the writing of this post, the following commands are available:
- create - Creates a stack using the CloudFormation template file under ~/.config/go-furnace
- delete - Deletes the created Stack. Doesn&rsquo;t do anything if the stack doesn&rsquo;t exist
- push - Pushes an application to a stack
- status - Displays information about the stack
- delete-application - Deletes the CodeDeploy application and deployment group created by <code>push</code></p>

<p>These commands represent the heart of furnace. I would like to keep these to a minimum, but I do plan on adding more, like
<code>update</code> and <code>rollout</code>. Further details and help messages on these commands can be obtained by running: <code>./furnace help</code> or
<code>./furnace help create</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">❯ ./furnace help push
Usage: furnace push appName [-s3]

Push a version of the application to a stack

Examples:
  furnace push
  furnace push appName
  furnace push appName -s3
  furnace push -s3
</code></pre>

<h3 id="config">config</h3>

<p>Contains the configuration loader and some project wide defaults which are as follows:
- Events for the plugin system - <code>pre-create</code>, <code>post-create</code>, <code>pre-delete</code>, <code>post-delete</code>.
- CodeDeploy role name - <code>CodeDeployServiceRole</code>. This is used if none is provided to locate the CodeDeploy IAM role.
- Wait frequency - Is the setting which controls how long the waiter should sleep in between status updates. Default is <code>1s</code>.
- Spinner - Is just the number of the spinner to use.
- Plugin registry - Is a map of functions to run for the above events.</p>

<p>Further more, config loads the CloudFormation template and checks if some necessary settings are present in the environment, exp:
the configuration folder under <code>~/.config/go-furnace</code>.</p>

<h3 id="utils">utils</h3>

<p>These are some helper functions which are used throughout the project. To list them:
- error_handler - Is a simple error handler. I&rsquo;m thinking of refactoring this one to some saner version.
- spinner - Sets up which spinner to use in the waiter function.
- waiter - Contains the verbose waiter introduced above under <a href="##Waiters">Waiters</a>.</p>

<h2 id="configuration-and-environment-variables">Configuration and Environment variables</h2>

<p>Furnace is a Go application, thus it doesn&rsquo;t have the luxury of Ruby or Python where the configuration files are usually bundled
with the app. But, it does have a standard for it. Usually, configurations reside in either of these two locations. Environment
Properties or|and configuration files under a fixed location ( i.e. HOME/.config/app-name ). Furnace employs both.</p>

<p>Settings like, region, stack name, enable plugin system, are under environment properties ( though this can change ), while the
CloudFormation template lives under <code>~/.config/go-furnace/</code>. Lastly it assumes some things, like the Deployment IAM role just
exists under the used AWS account. All these are loaded and handled by the config package described above.</p>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>A typical scenario for Furnace would be the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Setup your CloudFormation template or use the one provided. The one provided sets up a highly available and self healing setting
using Auto-Scaling and Load-Balancing with a single application instance. Edit this template to your liking than copy it to
<code>~/.config/go-furnace</code>.</li>
<li>Create the configured stack with <code>./furnace create</code>.</li>
<li>Create will ask for the parameters defined in the template. If defaults are setup, simply hitting enter will use these defaults.
Take note, that the provided template sets up SSH access via a provided key. If that key is not present in CF, you won&rsquo;t be able
to SSH into the created instance.</li>
<li>Once the stack is completed, the application is ready to be pushed. To do this, run: <code>./furnace push</code>. This will locate the
appropriate version of the app from S3 or GitHub and push that version to the instances in the Auto-Scaling group. To all of
them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="general-practices-applied-to-the-project">General Practices Applied to the Project</h2>

<h3 id="commands-1">Commands</h3>

<p>For each command the main entry point is the <code>execute</code> function. These functions are usually calling out the small chunks of
distributed methods. Logic was kept to a bare minimum ( probably could be simplified even further ) in the execute functions
mostly for testability and the likes. We will see that in a followup post.</p>

<h3 id="errors">Errors</h3>

<p>Errors are handled immediately and usually through a fatal. If any error occurs than the application is halted. In followup
versions this might become more granular. I.e. don&rsquo;t immediately stop the world, maybe try to recover, or create a Poller or
Re-Tryer, which tries a call again for a configured amount of times.</p>

<h3 id="output-colors">Output colors</h3>

<p>Not that important, but still&hellip; Aesthetics. Displaying data to the console in a nice way gives it some extra flare.</p>

<h3 id="makefile">Makefile</h3>

<p>This project works with a Makefile for various reasons. Later on, once the project might become more complex, a Makefile makes it
really easy to handle different ways of packaging the application. Currently, for example, it provides a <code>linux</code> target which will
make Go build the project for Linux architecture on any other Architecture i.e. cross-compiling.</p>

<p>It also provides an easy way to run unit tests with <code>make test</code> and installing with <code>make &amp;&amp; make install</code>.</p>

<h1 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h1>

<p>That is all for Part 2. Join me in Part 3 where I will talk about the experimental Plugin system that Furnace employs.</p>

<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>

<p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>Previously on this blog: <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/16/building-furnace-part-1/">Part 1</a>, <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/03/22/building-furnace-part-3/">Part 3</a>, <a href="https://skarlso.github.io/2017/04/16/building-furnace-part-4/">Part 4</a></p>

<p>In this part, I&rsquo;m going to talk about the AWS Go SDK and begin do dissect the intricacies of Furnace.</p>

<h1 id="aws-sdk">AWS SDK</h1>

<p>Fortunately, the Go SDK for AWS is quiet verbose and littered with examples of all sorts. But that doesn&rsquo;t make it less complex
and less cryptic at times. I&rsquo;m here to lift some of the early confusions, in hopes that I can help someone to avoid wasting time.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started-and-developers-guide">Getting Started and Developers Guide</h2>

<p>As always, and common from AWS, the documentation is top notch. There is a 141 pages long developer&rsquo;s guide on the SDK containing
a getting started section and an API reference. Go check it out. I&rsquo;ll wait. <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/aws-sdk-go-dg.pdf">AWS Go SDK DG PDF</a>. I will only talk about some gotchas and things I encountered, not the basics of the SDK.</p>

<h2 id="aws-string-and-other-types">aws.String and other types</h2>

<p>Something which is immediately visible once we take a look at the API is that everything is a pointer. Now, there are a
tremendous amount of discussions about this, but I&rsquo;m with Amazon. There are various reasons for it, but to list the most prominent
ones:
    - Type completion and compile time type safety.
    - Values for AWS API calls have valid zero values, in addition to being optional, i.e. not being provided at all.
    - Other option, like, empty interfaces with maps, or using zero values, or struct wrappers around every type, made life much
       harder rather than easier or not possible at all.
    - The AWS API is volatile. You never know when something gets to be optional, or required. Pointers made that decision easy.</p>

<p>There are good number of other discussions around this topic, for example: <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go/issues/363">AWS Go GitHub #363</a>.</p>

<p>In order to use primitives, AWS has helper functions like <code>aws.String</code>. Because &amp;&ldquo;asdf&rdquo; is not allowed, you would have to create a
variable and use its address in situations where a string pointer is needed, for example, name of the stack. These primitive helpers will
make in-lining possible. We&rsquo;ll see later that they are used to a great extent. Pointers, however, make life a bit difficult when
constructing Input structs and make for poor aesthetics.</p>

<p>This is something I&rsquo;m returning in a test for stubbing a client call:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">		return &amp;cloudformation.ListStackResourcesOutput{
			StackResourceSummaries: []*cloudformation.StackResourceSummary{
				{
					ResourceType:       aws.String(&quot;NoASG&quot;),
					PhysicalResourceId: aws.String(&quot;arn::whatever&quot;),
				},
			},
		}
</code></pre>

<p>This doesn&rsquo;t look so appealing, but one gets used to it quickly.</p>

<h2 id="error-handling">Error handling</h2>

<p>Errors also have their own types. An AWS error looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">if err != nil {
    if awsErr, ok := err.(awserr.Error); ok {
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>First, we check if error is nil, than we type check if the error is an AWS error or something different. In the wild, this will
look something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	if err != nil {
		if awsErr, ok := err.(awserr.Error); ok {
			if awsErr.Code() != codedeploy.ErrCodeDeploymentGroupAlreadyExistsException {
				log.Println(awsErr.Code())
				return err
			}
			log.Println(&quot;DeploymentGroup already exists. Nothing to do.&quot;)
			return nil
		}
		return err
	}
</code></pre>

<p>If it&rsquo;s an AWS error, we can check further for the error code that it returns in order to identify what to handle, or what to throw
on to the caller to a potential fatal. Here, I&rsquo;m ignoring the AlreadyExistsException because, if it does, we just go on to a next
action.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Luckily the API doc is very mature. In most of the cases, they provide an example to an API call. These examples, however, from
time to time provide more confusion than clarity. Take CloudFormation. For me, when I first glanced upon the
description of the API it wasn&rsquo;t immediately clear that the <code>TemplateBody</code> was supposed to be the whole template, and that
the rest of the fields were almost all optional settings. Or provided overrides in special cases.</p>

<p>And since the template is not an ordinary JAML or JSON file, I was looking for something that parses it into that the Struct I
was going to use. After some time, and digging, I realized that I didn&rsquo;t need that, and that I just need to read in the template,
define some extra parameters, and give the TemplateBody the whole of the template. The parameters defined by the CloudFormation
template where extracted for me by <code>ValidateTemplate</code> API call which returned all of them in a convenient
<code>[]*cloudformation.Parameter</code> slice. These things are not described in the document or visible from the examples. I mainly found
them through playing with the API and focused experimentation.</p>

<h2 id="waiters">Waiters</h2>

<p>From other SDK implementations, we got used to Waiters. These handy methods wait for a service to become available or for certain
situations to take in effect, like a Stage being <code>CREATE_COMPLETE</code>. The Go waiters, however, don&rsquo;t allow for callback to be fired,
or for running blocks, like the ruby SDK does. For this, I wrote a handy little waiter for myself, which outputs a spinner to see
that we are currently waiting for something and not frozen in time. This waiter looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">// WaitForFunctionWithStatusOutput waits for a function to complete its action.
func WaitForFunctionWithStatusOutput(state string, freq int, f func()) {
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)
	done := make(chan bool)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		f()
		done &lt;- true
	}()
	go func() {
		counter := 0
		for {
			counter = (counter + 1) % len(Spinners[config.SPINNER])
			fmt.Printf(&quot;\r[%s] Waiting for state: %s&quot;, yellow(string(Spinners[config.SPINNER][counter])), red(state))
			time.Sleep(time.Duration(freq) * time.Second)
			select {
			case &lt;-done:
				fmt.Println()
				break
			default:
			}
		}
	}()

	wg.Wait()
}
</code></pre>

<p>And I&rsquo;m calling it with the following method:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">	utils.WaitForFunctionWithStatusOutput(&quot;DELETE_COMPLETE&quot;, config.WAITFREQUENCY, func() {
		cfClient.Client.WaitUntilStackDeleteComplete(describeStackInput)
	})
</code></pre>

<p>This would output these lines to the console:</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">[\] Waiting for state: DELETE_COMPLETE
</code></pre>

<p>The spinner can be configured to be one of the following types:</p>

<pre><code class="language-go">var Spinners = []string{`←↖↑↗→↘↓↙`,
	`▁▃▄▅▆▇█▇▆▅▄▃`,
	`┤┘┴└├┌┬┐`,
	`◰◳◲◱`,
	`◴◷◶◵`,
	`◐◓◑◒`,
	`⣾⣽⣻⢿⡿⣟⣯⣷`,
	`|/-\`}
</code></pre>

<p>Handy.</p>

<p>And with that, let&rsquo;s dive into the basics of Furnace.</p>

<h1 id="furnace">Furnace</h1>

<h2 id="directory-structure-and-packages">Directory Structure and Packages</h2>

<p>Furnace is divided into three main packages.</p>

<h3 id="commands">commands</h3>
