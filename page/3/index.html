Today&rsquo;s is a quick tip for keeping your forks updated.
If you are like me, and have at least a 100 forks in your repository because: * You would like to contribute at some point * Save it for yourself because you are afraid that it disappears * Would like to make modifications for your own benefit * Whatever the reason
&hellip;then you probably have a lot of trouble keeping them updated and making sure you always see the latest change.

I&rsquo;m going to deploy a distributed application with Kubernetes. I attempted to create an application that I thought resembled a real world app. Obviously I had to cut some corners due to time and energy constraints.
My focus will be on Kubernetes and deployment.
Shall we delve right in?
The Application TL;DR The application itself consists of six parts.

He also has some Go contributions and check out his project here: Protobuf. It&rsquo;s GopherJS Bindings for ProtobufJS and gRPC-Web.
It was interesting to see where these projects could lead and I see the potential in them. I liked the usage of Protobuf and gRPC, I don&rsquo;t have THAT much experience with them.

Today, I would like demonstrate how to use Ansible in order to construct a server hosting multiple HTTPS domains with Nginx and LetsEncrypt. Are you ready? Let&rsquo;s dive in.
TL;DR What you will need There is really only one thing you need in order for this to work and that is Ansible. If you would like to run local tests without a remote server, than you will need Vagrant and VirtualBox.

In the past couple of months I&rsquo;ve been slowly updating Furnace.
There are three major changes that happened. Let&rsquo;s take a look at them, shall we?
Google Cloud Platform Furnace now supports Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It provides the same API to handle GCP resource as with AWS. Namely, create, delete, status, update. I opted to leave out push because Google mostly works with git based repositories, meaning a push is literary just a push, than Google handles distributing the new code by itself.

Today I would like to write about an AWS finger practice.
Previously, I wrote about how I build and deploy my blog with Wercker. Since, I&rsquo;m a cloud engineer and I dislike Oracle and it&rsquo;s ever expending tenctacles into the abyss, I wanted to switch to use something else.
My build and deploy cycle is simple.

Quick note. Furnace now comes pre-compiled easy to access binaries which you can download and use out of the box.
No need to install anything, or compile the source. Just download, unzip and use.
Here is the website: Furnace Website.
Enjoy, Cheers, Gergely.

You could opt in using eval with a constructor parameter, but generally, it was considered to be unsafe. Thus, normally when a project was using it, like Huginn they had to opt out by default, thus missing out on sweet parsing like this: $.
