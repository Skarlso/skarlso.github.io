                        <p>Is TDD dead?</p>

<p>Not really. So let&#8217;s talk about this topic for a little bit.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you already read a gazillion posts about this debate but frankly I&#8217;m writing this for myself, to rant a little bit, you know&#8230; Because somebody is wrong on the internet and I must intervene.</p>

<p></p>

<p>So first of all, the hashtag #tddisdead (and I will use it shamelessly as well). This is clearly an attempt to get as many peoples attention as you can. TDD is NOT DEAD. Obviously since it has soooo many supporters how could it be dead? It&#8217;s like asking, is Design Patterns dead? Or is Functional Automation dead? Or is Oreo cookies dead?</p>

<p>No, it&#8217;s not dead. And it won&#8217;t ever be dead. It will maybe change into something new, something better even, but it will never be dead. So let&#8217;s skip that part.</p>

<p>Now, about the <strong>debate</strong>.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t hear so much bull spoken for this long since I watched the political debate of two fractions in my home country. The right wing extremists against the left wing&#8230;. I don&#8217;t know whats. And it was just that. A political debate. It had no merit and no value whatsoever. At all. Nothing.</p>

<p>And right in the middle <strong>DHH</strong> says this:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;&#8230;you&#8217;re not done until you also have tests for a piece of functionality &#8212; I&#8217;m completely on board with that.&#8221;.</em></p>

<p>That made the whole conversation completely irrelevant.</p>

<p>Every counter against TDD I heard was <strong>bull</strong>. Not in that debate, in general. People are either too lazy to write them, just don&#8217;t want to get out of their comfort zone, don&#8217;t really care about tests, or don&#8217;t really care about quality or under time pressure ( I get to this later. ).</p>

<p>Which brings me to my next point.</p>

<p><strong>Quality</strong></p>

<p>People seem to not care about quality that much. Would they, they would understand that having a bulletproof west will save your life when you get shot in the chest with a 357 magnum. You can flush out early design flaws you can detect early bugs and do a better system design.</p>

<p>Sure if you are the most intelligent man on the planet maybe you can come up with a perfect system on the first draft and then implement it flawlessly so that it doesn&#8217;t fall apart in two months time. But most people can&#8217;t. Most people make errors on the way.</p>

<p>And yes, writing tests can be hard. But guess what? If writing a test is hard because that part of the system is complicated, than it will be that part of the system which will react the worst to change. And only change is constant. Which brings me to the next item&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Time constraints</strong></p>

<p>So your manager is sitting right next to you and saying come on we are paying you to write code and not tests so do it! And you have to have a feature done today but if you write a suite of tests you&#8217;ll only finish tomorrow. Sure, your estimate at that point will become a very quick one because you make a sacrifice of trust.</p>

<p>And then the next story comes along and you say&#8230; <em>&#8220;Sure I can do that as well. No problem I know how my system works, right? Hmm&#8230; why the hell did that break all of a sudden? I didn&#8217;t change anything in that module&#8230; Ahh damn it I said I&#8217;ll be done today, so let&#8217;s just fix this quickly and then move on to the next card.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>And the next story comes along&#8230; <em>&#8220;Sure I can do that&#8230; wait a minute&#8230; Didn&#8217;t that part brake already twice? Damn, better refactor. Ohh shit, why is that now breaking???? Damn it I said I&#8217;ll be done tomorrow, better patch it, and then move on. Hmm let&#8217;s write a test here to make sure this does not break. Ohhh damn I need PowerMock for that stuff since it&#8217;s in another module. Why the hell is that there? Should it be here in the first place since it&#8217;s somehow used by that other class there? Interesting. Let&#8217;s refactor and put it in here so I can mock it. Ahhhh f*ck now all the rest of the system is not working. Damn, I&#8217;ll just use PowerMock. Shit. Checkstyle error. PowerMock is not allowed?? What?? Who the f*ck says that?&#8221;</em></p>

<p>You get my drift. And suddenly you end up with estimates of <strong>WEEKS</strong>!!!! instead of days / hours for a simple story.</p>

<p><strong>Finishing it up</strong></p>

<p>This a rant only. It&#8217;s my personal opinion, experience and observation of a 10 year time period in Software Testing. Starting with at least a Weak Skeleton and a few upfront tests will help you in the long run. Writing at least ONE &#8211; TWO acceptance tests WILL help you understand business logic better. Writing ONE or TWO unit tests will help you understand your logic better. I&#8217;m not saying write a whole damn suite of tests I can understand you don&#8217;t want to do that, but for quality&#8217;s sake write at least a couple.</p>

<p>You will love it, I promise you that.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody.</p>

<p>Today I would like to write about a very interesting topic, I hope. So let&#8217;s get started.</p>

<p>As the title already suggests, I&#8217;m writing about why a front-end tester should learn at least a little bit about JavaScripting and the DOM.</p>

<p>Ohhh and contrary to the belief CSP ( Content Security Policy ) will <strong>not</strong> be the death of such scripts. There are white-lists and workarounds and exclusions which can be implemented in order to allow local JavaScripting to continue. So don&#8217;t fret&#8230; Read on.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 1: Injection</strong></p>

<p>Every front-ender tester has a waste amount of tools at their disposal. Various things, like FirebugÂ and web developer ToolbarÂ and&#8230; Bookmarklets and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/" target="_blank">Greasemonkey</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en" target="_blank">Tampermonkey</a>. These are the real powerful tools though. Your main objective at this point would be to inject something into your current site.</p>

<p>Suppose a scenario where you are testing something and you have an API at your disposal for a quick edit on a customer, like closing his account or giving him money, or doing something with his appliances. Suppose you don&#8217;t want to always switch away to another tab or call a service with certain parameters or go to a rest client and initiate that from there.</p>

<p>Suppose you could have a small injected DIV right on the page you are which gathers information for you, like the customer&#8217;s username, and wallet and whatnot, and with a simple press of a button, you just closed their account. Neat, isn&#8217;t it? Simple, fast, very comfortable with just one press of a button.</p>

<p>Suppose you have a DIV at the corner of a page, or even a drag and drop enabled one which you can drag around, with an arsenal of these buttons RIGHT THERE on your page. You don&#8217;t have to switch context at all.</p>

<p>These days it&#8217;s especially easy with tools like jQuery at your disposal. You just inject jQuery first, if the site is not already using it, and you are good to go and do whatever you like to do&#8230;.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 2: Data gathering</strong></p>

<p>While we are testing these application we always create some kind of a report. That report contains many things about the customer, or it&#8217;s appliances or the things he does, does not. All these could be constantly gathered by your script as it runs in the background. It gathers statistics and information which otherwise you would have to gather from some transaction history, or some kind of an action history. But no&#8230; Not the JavaScript Wizard.</p>

<p>You, would just press a button and the script would generate a report for you. It would even print it out. Create a persistent layer in which you are gathering information continuously. Create a small mySql database on your local machine and have the JavaScript enter data into that. Tadaaam&#8230;. Usage statistics at the touch of a button. All there, only waiting to be extracted.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 3: Tempering</strong></p>

<p>In understanding the ways of the DOM and the JavaScript you can create some very interesting test cases not to mention XSS attacks which is essentially JavaScript Injection. That&#8217;s always fun and produces many very good bugs.</p>

<p>Cookie manipulation. You want to simulate something? Like a time-out or a session loss or anything like that with a push of a button? Easy&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 4: Shortcuts</strong></p>

<p>You have a massive field like registration that you need to fill out? The shortest way is to have an API which you can call via a curl script. But if that&#8217;s not available and you would like to exercise the front-end any ways, then you will end up wasting hours and hours on always filling out all of those pesky fields.</p>

<p>And suddenly I&#8217;m hearing: &#8220;But I&#8217;m using Selenium plugin for that.&#8221; &#8211; you might say. Sure, use that. But I&#8217;m using Chrome. &#8220;But there is iMacros for that.&#8221; &#8211; you might say again. Sure, I know&#8230; But! Let&#8217;s see which takes longer&#8230;</p>

<p>Open selenium, load the script, run it, see it fail, run it again, ahh success, good. Same with iMacros. As opposed to, having a Bookmarklet right in front of you, on your bookmark, and with a click of a button, or with entering something into the browsers search bar, you suddenly fill out the form and press submit.</p>

<p>You see the difference is that JavaScript runs faster and more accurate by it self in such short things then with a wrapper around it. And it&#8217;s faster accessible as well.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 5: Security</strong></p>

<p>There are all sorts of things that a security tester can do with a small script which gathers session information and availability.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Number 6: Accessibility</strong></p>

<p>This is of course the easiest one. There are ample of scripts and browser plugins to test accessibility which is an all time favourite for everybody in the front-end land. Make your life a little bit easier. How bout just running a bookmark like <a href="http://squizlabs.github.io/HTML_CodeSniffer/">HTML_CodesSniffer</a> an see a very gorgeous result like this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i1-scripts.softpedia-static.com/screenshots/HTML-CodeSniffer_1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Ain&#8217;t it beautiful? What stops YOU from writing your own?</p>

<p>So get out there and learn JavaScript. It&#8217;s easy. I&#8217;m not telling you to become a front-end developer, just know thy tools and you shellet receive the blessings of the IT Gods.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>Today I would like to tell you about a little conversation I had with my friend Adrian.</p>

<p>The topic was about how, when and what to log during a testing session regarding a story.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s see what came out of that talk&#8230;</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>Logging your work</strong></p>

<p>The question is really not whether you should log your work or not, but rather to what extend. Because we all know that you should log your work. It helps you recall and helps you organize and think out testing strategies. But the extend and methods are a big question. So here is my routine.</p>

<p><strong>Visually inclined</strong></p>

<p>I am a very visual person. I log my work with doodles and such like <a href="http://www.huibschoots.nl/wordpress/">Mr. Huib Schoots</a> who uses Sketchnote taking. You have seen some of my sketches if you follow my twitter feed, like this one =&gt; <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BAm6RSTCMAEvjas.jpg" alt="" />. You know I like to draw so for me colour and organizing and doodling is key to make a note more personalized and live.</p>

<p>That comes with a drawback. The draw back are many&#8230;</p>

<p>First of, I need to do that in a notebook. I could bring my wacoom tablet to work and draw in paint, but that wouldn&#8217;t be the same. And I don&#8217;t particularly like drawing on a tablet actually.</p>

<p>Second one, it&#8217;s completely unsearchable. As Adrian pointed out, you can&#8217;t search in a notebook, even if you are using side pointers like a sticky note or something. You won&#8217;t be able to instantly find and track down something you did. And after a while it gets cluttered with doodles and the notes are lost in-between. It will be very colourful and utterly useless.</p>

<p>Third one is, it&#8217;s slow. Typing is much faster.</p>

<p>On the bright side&#8230; I love doodling. And if I can draw something up with a picture I will understand it much faster rather then reading a few lines of words chunked together.</p>

<p>If I draw an awesome diagram I will get what&#8217;s going on much much faster.</p>

<p>And it will be more fun to actually right it down with a nice fountain pen with a beautiful tip that can create such marvels that you don&#8217;t want to put it down.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s portable. I can carry my notebook everywhere. I should be able to do the same with a laptop, but since it&#8217;s tied into a dock station and I don&#8217;t want to carry it around with myself everywhere I won&#8217;t do that. I could create notes though in my notebook and then write them down into the laptop after I&#8217;m done? Sure&#8230;</p>

<p>So now let&#8217;s go and see the other one.</p>

<p><strong>Electronic note-taking</strong></p>

<p>I think I already pointed out a few positives about that. It&#8217;s searchable. Definitely. It&#8217;s fast. Yes. It&#8217;s more convenient, more organized can be backed up and you won&#8217;t run out of ink or space or somebody won&#8217;t take it away to a meeting because &#8220;Ohh I saw it on your desk and I needed a paper hope that&#8217;s okay.&#8221;.</p>

<p>I understand the benefits of it. But it&#8217;s very very rigid. It has no colour, no personalization and no feeling whatsoever. It&#8217;s frigid, standardized and without life. So I need something to make it a bit better. I have a couple of tools for that.</p>

<p>First off I need a good graphics maker to create diagrams. There is an awesome free tool pointed out by Adrian to do that called <a href="http://www.yworks.com/en/products_download.php">yEd</a>. Download the zip and run the jar. I can live with that. Creates nice diagrams and flowcharts.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/swcdn5N.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s quite powerful. Go look it up. There are a gazillion picture on Ze internet.</p>

<p>But the notes still lack personalization. There are a couple of tools which you can use if you, like me, shy away from everything that&#8217;s Microsoft, you have the opportunity to use Emacs with the org plugin which makes absolutely amazing documents.</p>

<p><img src="http://dto.github.io/images/tutorial-11.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>It&#8217;s awesome but the problem is that it will only work with Emacs and nothing else. And from time to time I don&#8217;t like the controls of Emacs. I&#8217;m a sublime text person. So recently I found a little plugin for sublime text called <a href="https://github.com/aziz/PlainTasks">PlainTask</a>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how it can look like: <img src="http://www.nealsheeran.com/images/plaintasks.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I LOVE it. You can add little notes and set a task to complete or defer it and it sort of highlights and things like that, which I like. It&#8217;s still not doodling but it get&#8217;s the job done and will be searchable and will be fast and available. And you can use Sublime text&#8217;s awesome power of foldering. Create a root folder and open it with sublime. Then create one folder / story you are testing and put everything related to that story in that directory and then press CTRL+O and unleash the magic!</p>

<p>Instant search and organization at the power of your fingertips. Even search IN the files themselves.</p>

<p>This makes it a bit better and bearable. Which brings me to the final topic.</p>

<p><strong>Note taking frequency</strong></p>

<p>So my friend argued that he create a folder for EVERY story he ever tests. Even if it&#8217;s only one word he puts into it to as a memory trigger he does it. I argued that that seems to be a little too extensive. But he said in return, and I have to agree on that, that once you stop doing something because of an excuse like, ahh I don&#8217;t need to do it because it&#8217;s a small story, you will stop doing it completely. And this is actually true for everything in your life. And as somebody who recently started running ( 1 month ago ) I understand the weight of that sentence very well.</p>

<p>So I would say do as much note taking as you can even if it is a little word that jogs your memory to remember some detail about the story. Even if it takes more time to create the folder and the note, it will help you at least to remember doing it and testing it if nothing else.</p>

<p>Although I don&#8217;t think I will do one for everything I will certainly try. Now with these awesome tools at my disposal I might even enjoy the rigidity of the keyboard more. ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Have a wonderful evening!</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>Today I would like to write a few words about Chrome&#8217;s Search Engines.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re probably already using it for a couple of things, like Google, or Amazon searches or YouTube or anything like that. But are you using it to access environments and testing tools faster, with queries?</p>

<p></p>

<p>For example, here is a quick Jira Search made easy:</p>

<p>Keyword: jira</p>

<p>URL: <a href="https://atlas.projectname.com/jira/browse/PROJECT-%s">https://atlas.projectname.com/jira/browse/PROJECT-%s</a></p>

<p>So just type: jira|space|9999</p>

<p>Will immediately bring you to your ticket.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah, why would I want that?&#8221; &#8211; you ask.</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s easy, and quick access, but wait. There is more. How about you want to access a test environment that changes only a number?</p>

<p>Keyword: testenv</p>

<p>URL: <a href="https://qa%s.projectname.com/testenv">https://qa%s.projectname.com/testenv</a></p>

<p>Just type: testenv|space|14</p>

<p>&#8220;Humbug!&#8221; &#8211; you might say. &#8220;What if I have a different URL for an admin site and my main web site AND the number, hmmm? Also I have that stuff bookmarked anyways&#8230;&#8221; &#8211; you might add in.</p>

<p>Well, don&#8217;t fret. By default, Chrome, does not provide this. I know FF does, but I don&#8217;t like FF. That&#8217;s that. So I have to make due with what I have. And indeed there is a solution for using multiple search parameters. It&#8217;s is a JavaScript you can add in into the URL part and Chrome will interpret that. You can find that JavaScript in a few posts but you will find that THAT script is actually Wrong. Here is the <strong>fixed</strong> Script, courtesy of yours truly:</p>

</div>

<p>So no you will have an entry like this:</p>

<p>Keyword: testenv</p>

<p>URL: paste in the upper script</p>

<p>And try&#8230; testenv|space|admin;14 =&gt; which should result in: <a href="https://admin.test14.projectname.com/">https://admin.test14.projectname.com/</a></p>

<p>The location.replace at the end will bring you to the web page. It&#8217;s interesting to note the s will be replaced by admin;14 which is a nice magic by JavaScript.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This only works on a page like google.co.uk. For chrome pages, like the new tab, omnibox has this ability disabled unfortunately.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then it&#8217;s completely useless, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; &#8211; you might say. Well, it&#8217;s usage is limited in power, that&#8217;s true. But it&#8217;s still useful as I&#8217;m sure you have a couple of pages open anyways which you don&#8217;t mind using up&#8230;? And you have to remember less keywords only a few powerful ones.</p>

<p>Credit for telling about Chrome Search Engines power in the first place goes to&#8230; *drumrolls* =&gt; <a href="http://www.testfeed.co.uk/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.testfeed.co.uk/">http://www.testfeed.co.uk/</a></a></p>

<p>Anyhow&#8230;</p>

<p>As always, thanks for reading.</p>

                        <p>Hello Everybody.</p>

<p>Today I would like to write about something non-technical. I would like to write about running and how I started it and what my experiences were with it.</p>

<p>So tl;dr&#8230; here we go.</p>

<p></p>

<p><strong>What led me to running</strong></p>

<p>There were actually two things that led me to start running. Three&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Reason One: The accident</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m a bike person by default. I *hate running with a passion. One day I was riding my bike in the woods when suddenly I hit a big ol&#8217; tree trunk right head on at which moment my bikes front fork bent inwards and became completely useless. At this point I had to walk home. Repairing it proved to be a bit time consuming so I had to think of some other way to have my regular exercise.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Two: The comic</strong></p>

<p>In the earlier days I&#8217;ve read a web comic from The Oatmeal, namely this one =&gt;<a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running" target="_blank"><a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/running</a></a></p>

<p>It inspired me so much I just needed a last kick to get started.</p>

<p><strong>Reason Three: The other accident</strong></p>

<p>About two years ago I had an accident and I broke my ankle. Cycling was one of the ways to exercise my ankle and now that my bike was gone I had to think of something else.</p>

<p>So with the Blerch on my back and all these wonderful reasons and because I believe that if you hate something but it&#8217;s good for you you have to find a way to make it your best friend&#8230;.I begun.</p>

<p><strong>How to begin&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>Hence my first todo item on the list was to start thinking like a runner. I would like to run today. I want to run. I love to run. I need to run. I miss running because it was a very bad weather outside and I couldn&#8217;t go and now I will run twice as much tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>Start running&#8230;</strong></p>

<p>This one seems obvious and&#8230; It is obvious. Just start it! Go out and run a few paces. It will give you a feel for how much you really need it because you are out of shape.</p>

<p>So&#8230; After I got my mind set on starting running and finally went outside a park which is nearby I started my first ever run.</p>

<p><strong>First time running</strong></p>

<p>Let me tell you at this point a few things you will need.</p>

<p>&#8211; A new heart</p>

<p>&#8211; Some lungs</p>

<p>&#8211; A new back</p>

<p>&#8211; Some legs</p>

<p>&#8211; And a couple of ribs</p>

<p>Your first run will be terrible. It will be awful. You will whease. You will shuffle. You will suffer and would like to give up immediately and go home an sit before the computer and do nothing and enjoy that none of your body parts hurt.</p>

<p>You need to get past this feeling. And don&#8217;t overrun on your first run. You don&#8217;t need to run 10k on the first try and you probably wouldn&#8217;t even make it. Just run for 10 &#8211; 20 minutes. You can walk in between if you get tired nobody will kill you for it or you won&#8217;t be less because of it. You can walk and bend a little bit. Your back will probably hurt so stretch a bit.</p>

<p>Which brings me to <strong>preparations</strong>.</p>

<p>People say that for short distances you don&#8217;t need to prepare. I call bull. Everything hurt on my body on my first try and on my second it was much better when I did it with preparation. A couple of things to do:</p>

<p>&#8211; Stretch = Important. Legs, back, front, side.</p>

<p>&#8211; Vaseline = If you have squishy parts on your body that touch while you are walking, like in between your legs just right after your pelvis where your legs connect, apply a bit of Vaseline. Trust me. You will be thankful for that. Where your body meets and if you run for 20-30 minutes it creates a log of friction. Vaseline helps you to protect against that. Later on long distance runners usually use it on their nipples to avoid getting a rush from the t-shirt they are wearing.</p>

<p>&#8211; Gear = This is an important one. I provide a different section.</p>

<p>Once you are geared up you are ready for your first run. It will be wonderfully painful but will be soooo gooood afterwards it&#8217;ll be all worth it.</p>

<p><strong>Gear</strong></p>

<p>Before you start running you need a proper <strong>shoe</strong>. There are countless blogs about what shoe to use what leg type you are and so and so forth I say f*ck that. On your first run make sure you by a basic running shoe like these =&gt;<a href="http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=4418011&lmdn=Price&fr=StorePrice%2FDSP%2F00005001%2F00010000&fbc=1&fbn=StorePrice%7C%2450.01+-+%24100.00" target="_blank">Shoes</a></p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t even matter if it&#8217;s a cheap one. A bit later when you feel you are ready you can invest into a proper running shoe. I&#8217;m using a Karrimor D3O. I heard absolute terrible reviews about it but frankly for me it&#8217;s extremely comfortable and I never had any problems with it. I like it. I might switch after a year or so and see how another brand fairs but for now, it&#8217;s perfect.</p>

<p>I advice against running for prolonged time with a shoe that&#8217;s not a running shoe. You will immediately feel the difference. As with a not running shoe your legs, back, side, lungs, heart everything will hurt very badly and you will hate running even more.</p>

<p>For a <strong>shirt</strong> I recommend this one =&gt; <a href="http://www.halfords.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_storeId_10001_catalogId_10151_productId_971728_langId_-1_categoryId_271427" target="_blank">Halfords Cycle Shirt</a></p>

<p>The colour is unimportant. And yes, it&#8217;s a cycling shirt. And why? Because it soaks up sweat immensely powerful. And it needs to be a tight fit for it to work. You will enjoy running much much more if you are not sweating all over the place.</p>

<p>For a <strong>pants</strong> I recommend this one =&gt; <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ultrasport-Mens-Quick-Dry-Function-Running-Tights/dp/B006HCSJS0/ref=sr_1_7?s=clothing&ie=UTF8&qid=1400268729&sr=1-7&keywords=running+pants" target="_blank">Amazon Man&#8217;s Running Tight</a></p>

<p>Why a tight? Because it will keep your muscles nicely wrapped and warm and it will soak up even more sweat and it really dries quickly and is easily washable. If it&#8217;s a nice weather outside, just put on a short and go.</p>

<p>A couple of things other Blogs don&#8217;t really talk or mention.</p>

<p>A <strong>running belt</strong>. It&#8217;s very useful to store stuff in it like =&gt;</p>

<p>&#8211; Keys</p>

<p>&#8211; Water</p>

<p>&#8211; Tissue =&gt; You will need it. Every part of your body will loose some type of liquid.</p>

<p>&#8211; Phone / Music playing device =&gt; There are <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/apr/22/does-music-help-you-run-faster" target="_blank">proven</a> <a href="http://naturalrunningcenter.com/2013/02/10/music-2/" target="_blank">fact</a> <a href="http://runnersconnect.net/running-training-articles/does-music-help-you-run-faster/" target="_blank">that</a> music will help you <a href="http://www.bostonmagazine.com/health/blog/2013/04/03/music-working-out/" target="_blank">run</a> <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/c25k/Pages/running-music.aspx" target="_blank">better</a></p>

<p>&#8211; GPS =&gt; For later because tracking your run will help you get it to improve.</p>

<p><strong>Closing words</strong></p>

<p>It will be hard to start. I know it will be. It was for me too. I&#8217;m running for a month now and I finally managed to get into a mind state where I actually LOVE it. I LOVE it. I want it. And I miss it if I&#8217;m not able to run. It&#8217;s a great exercise. Take care that don&#8217;t run everyday. It will make you very tired and give up easily. Run every second day and then increase as you like. But even then include <strong>REST</strong>(not the protocol&#8230;) because your body, tissues, muscle bones need to regenerate.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t overexert yourself. Jog, walk run slow. Doesn&#8217;t matter, just run. That&#8217;s the point.</p>

<p>Have a very clear mindset.</p>

<p>And run in nature if possible because a treadmill is immensely boring and will kill your mood very quickly. And running in nature will provide diversion and wonderful things like this (my view when I run) =&gt;</p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BmpyfhcIgAM2pFf.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After a month of running my record is 7kms and 50 minutes. I started from zero basically. The human is the best runner in the world. I lost 5kgs without changing my eating habits. Just right now as I&#8217;m typing this I&#8217;m chewing on a gummybear.</p>

<p>So get out there and start running folks. It will help you immensely. There will come the time when you feel the euphoric moment of speed and the wind in your face as your body explodes in a glorious mixture of pain, adrenalin rush, speed, velocity, happiness and bliss. As your body stretches and pulls your weight and your legs launch you forward into the world the feeling as you run faster and faster ignoring everything and just fly. You will start to cry, laugh and sing at the same time.</p>

<p>Running will do that to you.</p>

<p>You have been warned.</p>

<p>Now go&#8230;. and live a full life.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for reading!</p>

                        <p>Hello.</p>

<p>This is only a quick rant about a discussion I overheard the other day&#8230;</p>

<p></p>

<p>Guy A says to guy B that my Past is not defining me. And that I&#8217;m not regarding my Past in my future endeavours. And that my Past isn&#8217;t what shapes me.</p>

<p>Well then what is? You constantly relay on your past experience like a crouch. You use it daily for making decisions. You don&#8217;t even realize it probably that you are using past events to determine if you want to do something or not.</p>

<p>Same goes as well for software development. You rely on your past as a means of estimation on a daily basis. If you wouldn&#8217;t do that, you would do very very poorly on estimations. You rely on those moments to find out what kind of consequences the solution you are using will have in the future. In fact, if we look at Design Patterns what are they, if not using the Past to determine the Future? Past failures, solutions and experience condensed into reusable ideas and modules.</p>

<p>So lastly I would depart with a little anecdote I like so very very much from Confucius.:</p>

<p><strong><em>&#8220;Study the past, if you would define/divine the future.&#8221;</em></strong></p>

<p>As always, thanks for reading!</p>

                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>A quick post about an interesting idea.</p>

<p>I want to elaborate on a possibility to use the Strategy Design pattern.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are many clues that you need one. One is for example if your object has a boolean variable which you use a lot in other classes to determine behavior. Then there is perhaps time to implement a Strategy.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

</div>

<p>So you have two classes which do something based on some boolean coming from a class. So what you can do in this case, simply extract out that change in state.</p>

<p>Now I know this looks like a lot of more code. However imagine this on a much larger scale with lots of implementations for Foo and Bar. Your if statements will get very convulated very quickly. This way you abstract away the choice into a Factory. And you can add as many implementations of Base as you like with as many variants as you like without changing the logic anywhere else but the Factory and the Enum. And the Enum could be a Configuration file and you do something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">   <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">static</span> Base getMeAClass<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #003399;">String</span> className<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span>
        <span style="color: #666666; font-style: italic;">//Where className could be coming from a configuration file</span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Class</span> clazz <span style="color: #339933;">=</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Class</span>.<span style="color: #006633;">forName</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>className<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
        <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">return</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span>Base<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> clazz.<span style="color: #006633;">newInstance</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span>
    <span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This way you don&#8217;t even need the Enum anymore. Just use some configuration to determine what class you need at which point in your implementation without using an If statement at all.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I whipped this up from memory so please feel free to tell me if I missed something or have a syntax error in there somewhere&#8230;</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

                        <p>Hello.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s clarify this&#8230; They rarely or ever work if you are a beginner blogger. If you have a reputation it will probably work or people will use it as a reference. But I&#8217;m skipping ahead.</p>

<p><strong>Beginnings</strong></p>

<p>When you are a beginner blog writer you want to get out as much content as possible. Write mostly relevant things and interesting information because you need to establish a name for yourself. To get that starting you want to be as interesting as possible and make people leave with the intent to come back for more.</p>

<p>After you&#8217;ve established a name for yourself you can do larger, more coherent updates with more information in between the line because people know you and know what you write is worth reading. Also you have to bear in mind that longer posts are rarely read to the fullest. They are skimmed and then if it is good it will be used as reference material or a post to point to. Also people rarely have a lot of time on their hand to read a long post, several smaller chunks can be digested more easily!</p>

<p><strong>Updating frequency</strong></p>

<p>In the age of modern information overload it is hard to be relevant and interesting and keep people to come back to you. Apart from what you are writing about, which is up to you, you have to schedule your updates to a certain frequency. You don&#8217;t want people to wait for to long but you don&#8217;t want to get them flooded either. Since people do read a lot of blogs they will choose carefully what to read and what to discard. And you might just end up on the discarded list if you already had a post at that moment.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m suggesting that you write you post what you would like to write at that moment and then use a scheduler to post it in certain frequencies. Maybe once or twice weekly is good enough. You need to experiment it out.</p>

<p><strong>Write, write, write</strong></p>

<p>The way to success is pawed with writing. You want to be visible and you want to keep people engaged with you. That means that you have to come up with content.</p>

<p>With a technical blog that&#8217;s a little bit difficult from time to time since so many people already might have solved your problem of which you are trying to write about. That&#8217;s okay. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a technical blog where you write about new ideas every day. It doesn&#8217;t have to be a troubleshoot blog about how to solve a particular problem.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t have to be about showing some people how to write this and that in a completely new environment.</p>

<p><strong>So about what then?</strong></p>

<p>Guess what? It&#8217;s up to you!!! If you wrote a script you like and are fond if, post it. If you created an interesting configuration, post it. If you wrote a line of code you find interesting, post it. You&#8217;ve read a blog post about something and have an opinion about it, post it. Is it scientific, some discovery, some idea, some random thought, post it! You wrote a particularly ugly script you never ever want to see, POST IT!!</p>

<p>Your blog doesn&#8217;t need to be a portfolio of how awesome you are. You are allowed to be human. You are allowed to post some very boring or trivial stuff you came across but YOU find it interesting! You don&#8217;t need to be new every day in every post.</p>

<p>So my suggestion is, write, write, write. As often as you like, schedule it and post it in a timely manner. Be responsive if people write you a comment always answer. Nobody likes an anonymous somebody who writes then disappears. People like bloggers who engage them and give a damn about their opinion as well.</p>

<p>Always be yourself. The blog is for you too so retain what ever you want to retain and read back later maybe to learn from it. And of course writing it down makes you remember it better.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

                        <p>Hello guys.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to share a little something with you. It&#8217;s what I cooked up in Python to check an unknown number of content items in a web application.</p>

<p>Basically the script runs from a script folder under Grails. It goes through all the configured folders where there is static content like images, javascript, css and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>And then with curl it calls these items up in using their respective paths&#8217;. This works best on localhost if you have your local environment configured to access these elements because in some places direct access is restricted.</p>

<p>This script only check static content. Dynamically generated content would have to be hard coded to check.</p>

<p>It only generated a file currently with ERROR on a not match an success on match and not found if it encounters an item which it doesn&#8217;t know about.</p>

<p>So without further ado&#8230; The Script:</p>

                        <p>Hello.</p>

<p>Today I would like to write about something very interesting to you folks.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a common remember / recall technique called the Method of loci. Otherwise known as the Memory Palace. A very popular usage can be seen in the episodes of Sherlock Holmes from BBC. He uses it often.</p>

<p><strong>What is the Method of loci?</strong></p>

<p>As the Wikipedia page write so properly&#8230;&#8221;In basic terms, it is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualization to organize and recall information.&#8221;</p>

<p>This says all&#8230;</p>

<p>So&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to go too much into details with this one since everybody can use Google I&#8217;m assuming but just for my sanities sake I will repeat a very basic idea. You brain works with associations. It can remember something when it&#8217;s linked to something you already know much much better. Also it can remember very easily places you&#8217;ve been to or people you&#8217;ve met. ( most of the time&#8230; ).</p>

<p>Very popular Roman Leaders where known to use this while they were giving speeches for hours out of memory. While they were speaking, mentally they were walking along a very well known and often used path where they linked key elements of their speeches to landmarks along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Enough. Show me concretes.</strong></p>

<p>So how do I make use of it you ask? I give you an example. In my flat there are two stairs. I use those stairs to initialize my Palace. I go up the two stairs to get myself into my Memory. Once I&#8217;m in my Palace, which is my flat, I have a lot of holder items like drawer, desk, wall, painting, couch and many many more.</p>

<p>So for example to recall all of the 23 design patterns in order I use a mnemonic and my palace.</p>

<p>I have three drawers. I go up up&#8230; there is my drawer before me. I open the first and out comes the following sight&#8230;</p>

<p>Memento and Mediator are playing a game of Chess ( strategy ). There is a Visitor standing by who is Observing ( Observer ) the game. State is constantly recording the state of the game while Template is providing support and Iterator is counting rounds. Command is constantly yelling orders that they should hurry up because he has better things to do while wielding a huge broad sword ( Interpreter -&gt; for me this pattern was used in MUD games which were early RPGs ). The whole gang is held together by a Chain which is responsible for not letting things go out of hand.</p>

<p>I know this sounds very complicated. And the order? Where is that? That&#8217;s the mnemonic: CCIIMMOSSTV. Easy, right?</p>

<p>So why this huge story around a few patterns? Because it&#8217;s not just these. Then along comes ABCDFFP which is Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight and Proxy and the rest BFFPS which is Builder, Factory, Abstract Factory, Prototype and Singleton.</p>

<p>I have stories around those as well. This makes it easy to remember them.</p>

<p>For small amount of things it would be an overkill yes. But for many things it makes it EASY!</p>

<p>You already remembered my Chess play story. ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p><strong>But how do you remember a complex story?</strong></p>

<p>Recall. You don&#8217;t just put stuff in there and then move on. I have a routine. Every day when I go to bed before I fall asleep I walk around in my Palace. I look at things, recall them strengthen the memory a bit here and there. And after an Item has been retained in my long term memory strong enough, I can recall it fewer and fewer times. So I don&#8217;t have to walk in the whole palace every time. Only parts.</p>

<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>But isn&#8217;t this too slow to recall something?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>This is only a tool to retain information more easily. Of course if you want to recall something at a moments notice, you won&#8217;t have the time to go into your palace and search around. But after a while it will strengthen and will be more and more easier to recall information faster and faster. And you rarely get into a position where you need to recall something in a second.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>This seems like a major overhead to learn something.</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>For small amount of information I suggest using a mnemonic or flash cards rather then a palace.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>What if I run out of space?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>You can create as many locations as you like. Use your current home and homes in your past which you knew very well. You could create a lane with houses after each other. Or create a fictional palace like Hogwarts based on some real places to retain them better. And draw a sketch of of it to be able to visualize it better.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>What if I forget where I put things?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>Recall recall recall is the name of the game. In order to stabilize the vision of your palace you need to practice walking around in it. Remembering each and every small room. With practice it will get better and better and every information will be stored much easier.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>How do you put thing into it? Can I just put in a number and I will remember it forever?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>Short answer: no. Long answer: You don&#8217;t just imagine a place and then put a whole bunch of words into a pocket somewhere and expect it to be recalled better. You need to combine the Loci with mnemonics and imagination and sounds and smells stories images. The more powerful the image in a place the better the recall. As you saw with the design patterns I didn&#8217;t just put a bunch of names into a box and then remembered it. I created a story around them and a mnemonic. The combination is the key.</p>

<p><strong>Q:</strong>Are you physically walking your house or in your mind?</p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>In my mind. Once I learned something and created my story and found the appropriate image or smell or sound I&#8217;d like to use I close my eyes and go into my palace in my mind. Then I start to place things where I think they will be in a good place. This can be any number of things. It&#8217;s up to you.</p>

<p>So that&#8217;s all folks. Hope you enjoyed it. Please feel free to try it out and experiment I assure you you won&#8217;t be disappointed.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
