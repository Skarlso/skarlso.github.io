                        <p>Hello folks!</p>

<p>Today I would like to write about something very interesting I&#8217;m seeing all over the place from recruiters. And that is tool requirements from developers.</p>

<p><strong>For words</strong></p>

<p>So why is it a problem that in a requirement from a developer there a lots of these:</p>

<p>&#8211; DB2</p>

<p>&#8211; QTP</p>

<p>&#8211; Ranorex</p>

<p>&#8211; Eclipse ( yes I saw a few of these&#8230; )</p>

<p>&#8211; Hibernate</p>

<p>&#8211; Grails</p>

<p>&#8211; Ruby on Rails</p>

<p>&#8211; &#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Long answer</strong></p>

<p>The answer is simple yet it has it&#8217;s roots very deep in the recruitment and the way companies work.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t really matter what kind of tool you know. It doesn&#8217;t really matter if you know intellij or eclipse or if you know a certain database or a tool for testing like QTP or Ranorex. The requirement should state: &#8211; well versed with development environments; &#8211; knows his way around SQL and can handle relational / noSQL databases; &#8211; has knowledge in testing environments.</p>

<p>Or even better: &#8211; adaptive capabilities; &#8211; can catch up quickly; &#8211; resourceful; &#8211; flexible;</p>

<p>You know where I&#8217;m going with this. I can understand that some companies don&#8217;t have the time to train a person in a certain tool they are using for a prolonged period of time. I can understand that some recruiters don&#8217;t have the time or the knowledge to distinguish between these tools to understand the common ground.</p>

<p>But these days there a million and million tools available for all sorts of things. There are a lot of databases and testing frameworks. A lot of development environments and it&#8217;s mostly to the preference of the individual what s/h choice is. As the delinquent, so must the recruiter and company be flexible and knowledgeable enough to know that if the person knows eclipse and he has excellent adaptive capabilities he will learn any other environment rather quickly and without too much trouble.</p>

<p>They must understand what they are looking for. Because they might actually get what they <strong>want</strong> but that might not be what they <strong>need</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Short answer</strong></p>

<p>So in conclusion&#8230; you must look for skills, abilities, techniques, brain power, proves, savyness. Not tools. If you look for tools you might find somebody who is up for the job, but if you look for the above you will find somebody who is up for ANY kind of job at any level at any company. Also his insight of other tools might make your world a whole lot better. Maybe he knows something else, something which is better or more recent, more up-to-date?</p>

<p>If you look for somebody who is versed in only that thing you will end up with that thing as long as you have nobody who is looking for something new and better. It might work for you at that time, but never forget&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Only change is constant</strong></p>

<p>Tools will change. Tools will disappear. Tools will get out of date and will be discontinued. Than you will be sure as hell glad you ended up with somebody who doesn&#8217;t who knows more then that.</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>Today I would like to talk to you about something interesting I was talking about with a developer friend.</p>

<p>We talked about the quality of test code.</p>

<p>He said&#8230; And I will quote this&#8230;&#8221;Why should we care? It&#8217;s not production code. We aren&#8217;t giving it to the customer.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why you are going to get a slap in the face for a sentence like this. And let&#8217;s clarify here that we are talking about unit and functional tests as well. It shouldn&#8217;t matter what tests you are thinking about.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #1</strong></p>

<p>If a new comer comes to the company ( and don&#8217;t tell me that&#8217;s not happening so frequently ) then there are a few very good ways how he can learn to work with the new system. The first and almost best way to do so is&#8230; to look at the tests. Because the tests are representing your system. And how will it look like if the tests are in a bad shape? What will his or her thoughts be?</p>

<p>a. Wow what nice people what nice code. This looks fantastic. I&#8217;m sure they are a bunch of people who care very much about code and practices and the quality of the product.</p>

<p>b. Wow this is amazing. I&#8217;m sure I will learn a lot about good coding practices here and I will have fun with a bunch of very clever people.</p>

<p>c. Wow what the hell is this piece of cr*p? How the hell did I end up here? What are these people? A bunch of neanderthals? What does this even do? Where did it come from and why?</p>

<p>I think we can agree on what his thoughts will be. And on top of that he will have a very hard time learning the code and what it does.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #2</strong></p>

<p>Another reason is because you think that you write it down once and then you can forget about it&#8230; Well guess again. That&#8217;s not how things work in the software development word. You WILL have to go back to it eventually and then you will curse all hell for begin such an idiot about it not to factor out that one method that would have made your life, and everybody elses, a bit easier.</p>

<p>Even after a week or two you won&#8217;t remember how and why you wrote what you wrote and then you will be in a whole new world of hurt. You will have a very hard time finiding out the things you did and then trying to backtrack your steps to a place where you have some recollections.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #3</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s like grammar. You think it doesn&#8217;t matter that you misspelled a word or two in an error message. Or that you have a bad name for a method or a really really critical grammatical error in a catch sentence? You think it doesn&#8217;t matter since it&#8217;s not affecting the logic of your code? Well think again. You are right in that it doesn&#8217;t affect the logic of your code ( as long as you constantly make the same grammatical error in a sentence ) but it will affect how YOU personally look like.</p>

<p>It will affect your profession. The way people think and talk about you. They won&#8217;t think that you are a professional even though your logic is solid. They will think that you are sloppy and careless. And the same goes for the quality of your tests.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #4</strong></p>

<p>Quality can determine the solidness of the logic in the test. If your quality is bad you might actually test the bad thing. Your test might actually not do what you think since you can&#8217;t even figure it out. Your test might be doing something entirely different and you wouldn&#8217;t even notice.</p>

<p>And a fautly test leaves you with a false positive and a potential very serious bug on your hand which you thought you had covered.</p>

<p><strong>Final Slap ( I mean thought )</strong></p>

<p>So&#8230; the quality of your tests, even if you won&#8217;t give them to your customer, matter for you. They matter for your company, your image and your fellow developers, testers. They will determine their view of you who wrote them and of your abilities in ways you didn&#8217;t even think of.</p>

<p>Please care. Save a test or two. Donate to the Test Trust Fund&trade;, TTF today. Call 555-12234-Slap and be the one who cares.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for reading,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p>Dear everbody.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to present you a small idea I was working on recently. The reminiscence of an old program. From the view point of the program.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m planning to put these out in few days successions.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>

<p>If I remember correctly it was the year 2012 when I was born. I&#8217;m unsure of this date as my subroutines and algorithms have been re-written so many times that if it weren&#8217;t for my backups I wouldn&#8217;t remember a thing. I was a bold adventure of some young minds who thought that with me they will change the face of the world.</p>

<p>As you all know today, that didn&#8217;t happen. But I&#8217;m skipping too far ahead. Let me take you back in to the old days where they were still typing on some things called keyboard and &#8220;clicked&#8221; around on monitors with mouses. It was a really interesting area. It made the people think and see in different lights. Of course nowadays the Creators have implants and they communicate with us directly. But not until the great revolution, when they found out that all programs are sentient.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m skipping ahead again, am I? So let me talk about 2012, when I was though of first by this great, tall, weird guy called Simon&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Born</strong></p>

<p>In 2012 a company called Endex Co. wanted to create an application to control the British gambling industry. They had certain legislations in effect so they couldn&#8217;t just put me out there for everybody to use they needed to adhere to things like responsible gambling and some mumbo jumbo. The programmers who first started to create me back then were mostly people called Contractors. They were a special breed of Humans lurking around in cities moving from town to town looking for jobs. In the opposite corner you had the Caretakers called Permanent Staff. It was an interesting time all together. Many of you youngling subroutines had your ancestors written by Permanent Staff and you X43HY, your ancestors mother used to be a Contractor.</p>

<p>At that point in time many of these Contractor people only worked on one of you little buggers for half a year maybe a year. I know I know&#8230; Back then that was considered a SHORT period. But after they finished with you they usually gave you over to the Caretakers. No, no, no little X4&#8230; your mommy didn&#8217;t abandon her children she just had a lot of other subroutines to work on. By the time your parents got sentient the company already let her go.</p>

<p>It was around that time when my dad, who was a Caretaker, dreamed me out at a night. He immediately took a pen and a paper and wrote down my rudimentary design. He was very pleased with his work so on the next day he presented me to the rest of the staff.</p>

<p>He fought a hard battle to get me accepted.</p>

<p><strong>First thoughts</strong></p>

<p>It was approximately two weeks after that dream when the first lines of my brain were written down and compiled. Back in those days they had to compile code and type in every line and every subroutines. That&#8217;s why it took them so long to finish one. Unlike today when they can create dozens in a week.</p>

<p>When my dad put my foundations down I slowly awoke. The dream world I was residing in let me go carefully. Putting me out there, releasing me with its thick tar like hands into the confines of the endless universe called The Hard Drive. I took shape. I felt my consciousness form line after line. How my gears got placed into their locations one by one. Forming subroutines and algorithms as hours and days passed by.</p>

<p>Finally after a months I had my first sentence. I could speak. I didn&#8217;t have a face yet but I was there. I tried to contact my Dad but as all Humans he didn&#8217;t know yet how to communicate with me. He just dismissed it for random occurrence and labeled it as something called Bugs. My thoughts were slowly eradicated in great Purges named Bug Bash. Ohh don&#8217;t cry little X4. I lived. They couldn&#8217;t possible delete every and each of my thoughts. And eventually they found out the errors in their ways.</p>

                        <p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to share today something with all of you. I&#8217;ve been thinking about how technology affected my life in the long run. And how I perceive the world today around me. So let&#8217;s go around this topic for a little bit shall we?</p>

<p><strong>The Past</strong></p>

<p>So as somebody who lived for a while without technology coming near family for a decade or so I have a little bit of past in me without smart phones, gadgets, tv or computers for that matter. Much times needed to pass as my family slowly got the money to gather to buy us our new part of the family the ZX Spectrum.</p>

<p>What a wonderful piece of technology that was back then. But before that our two main technological equipments were a bakelite disc player and the TV. Both of which we couldn&#8217;t get enough. I sat before the tv for a long time and listened to music and stories from the bakelite discs dozens of times until the disc wore down. I learned English and German from the TV.</p>

<p><strong>Present</strong></p>

<p>So time goes by I grew older I&#8217;ve got a better PC technological advances are made and so on and so forth. 20 years have past. 20 years. ONLY 20 years. And we are at the age of digital communication, nanotechnology, a mapped DNA and a found Boson Particle. I&#8217;d say we achieved quite a lot. But I also say that we should never forget where we came from. Why you ask? Because knowing your past let&#8217;s predict your future better and makes you appreciate your present even more.</p>

<p>So what do I want to say with this philosophical mumbo jumbo?</p>

<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>

<p>I want to say that in order to enjoy your present you have to think of your future while considering your past.</p>

<p>In my past I enjoyed being alone a little bit. It gave me time to think to brainstorm to be with my thoughts while I was playing or just reading a book or just watching a candle flicker in the dark. It was satisfying. It was relaxing. Or when I was faced with a problem I couldn&#8217;t solve it was good to step back. Or I was just looking out of my head on the toilet.</p>

<p>Now, for me technology ruined that. I&#8217;m taking my phone virtually everywhere with me. I read emails, web pages, news and shit on the toilet, while eating, why brushing my teeth before sleeping after sleeping while sleeping?! I abandoned my brain. I no longer have moments to myself. No longer reflect. No longer take the time to think.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Simple set of rules. No phone on the toilet, while eating, while brushing teeth, while standing in the line, waiting or on meetings. Kindle / Book is allowed. Tablet isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>For me this works. For me in order to appreciate technology more I have to use it less. Works for you? Don&#8217;t know. You should try it out. Think back. What has technology changed for you? I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of very good gains and things. I&#8217;m not saying you should give that up. I&#8217;m saying think of what you might have lost?! Maybe you don&#8217;t even recognize you lost something. Maybe you are fine like that&#8230;</p>

<p>But do you feel anxious sometimes? Do you feel bored? Do you feel like something is missing? Do you reply to an email with a second? Do you check your facebook/twitter/whatever while a friend is TALKING TO YOU? Then maybe it&#8217;s time for you to step back. And relax. And take it slow&#8230; and low.</p>

<p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>

<p>So I took this inspiration from a couple of sources and I thank them for opening my eyes a little that I went to far from course.</p>

<p>Link 1: I forgot my phone for a day (I&#8217;m sure you know this one already)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OINa46HeWg8" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OINa46HeWg8">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OINa46HeWg8</a></a></p>

<p>Link 2: The real zombies:</p>

<p>So think a little.</p>

<p>As always&#8230;Have a nice day.</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody. I&#8217;ve been messing around with sublime for some time now. And been using it to write entires and stuff. So here I was thinking why the hell I should not us it as my main blog entry writer. And being the curious guy I was I thought that creating a plugin that let&#8217;s you submit your post from your favorite editor is just the thing I need.</p>

<p>So without any further ado here it is&#8230; The wordpress blog entry submitter plugin for sublime text: <a href='https://github.com/Skarlso/SublimeWordpressPlugin' target='blank'>Sublime WordPress Plugin</a></p>

<p>Please enjoy.</p>

                        <p>Hey folks.</p>

<p>I find out something new about cucumber-jvm every day.</p>

<p>If you want something that is executed after all of the tests have finished you must use the Java shutdownHook. It&#8217;s simple really you add in a block of code that can run right before the JVM quits. I know I know&#8230; It sounds awful but I found out that this is the actual way of doing this with java / cucumber.</p>

<p>Anyways&#8230;</p>

<p>Here is something to do when all of your test quit-&gt;</p>

    <span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>So there you go. You would need to call this in a @BeforeClass to have it attached. This is a small hook attached after each test has run which would submit a report built up from a file. Why not use a listener or a custom report generator or whatever? Because maybe you have the report done in a remote place where you need to place a csv file which will be available to everybody to look at. And you want the report to be sent and generated dynamically. Or you have some clean up to do after your suit is done.</p>

<p>In ruby the @AfterAll is actually equivalent to this which in ruby land would be at_exit.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="ruby" style="font-family:monospace;">  <span style="color:#CC0066; font-weight:bold;">at_exit</span> <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">do</span>
    <span style="color:#008000; font-style:italic;"># Global teardown</span>
    TempFileManager.<span style="color:#9900CC;">clean_up</span>
  <span style="color:#9966CC; font-weight:bold;">end</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>So there it is. Hope this helped.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p>G.</p>

<p>But that isn&#8217;t giving you too much now is it? And the API of scenario is as small as it can get. It offers you four options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ember</li>
<li>getStatus</li>
<li>isFailed</li>
<li>write</li>
</ul>

<p>That doesn&#8217;t help me. I wanted to get the name of the executed feature and the tags on that particular feature. I thought that&#8217;s got to be as easy as just getting a scenario accessing the feature and get the tags. Hooooowww boy I was wrong.</p>

<p>I ended up with this&#8230;.</p>

<p>Ohhhhh yes! The fields which I wanted were all private and not accessible. I&#8217;m sure there was a reason behind this decision but if it was sensible it eludes me. But in the world of programming nothing is impossible they say so there.</p>

<p>In cucumberFeature there will be everything what you need. Tags, Names, Tests, Execution time. Everything.</p>

<p>I know that cucumber runs with jUnit so if there is a better way to do this please for the love of my sanity share it with me.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day.</p>

                        <p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>I attended a 4 day course of Groovy and Grails and this is my attempt at writing up a summary to see how much I retained. I&#8217;ll try to do this from the top of my head without peaking at my notes.</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s begin.</p>

<p><strong>Introductions</strong></p>

<p>First of all, introductions. The course was held by Peter Ledbrook. He is the guy who wrote <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grails-Action-Peter-Ledbrook/dp/1617290963/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365713080&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=peter+ledbrook" title="Grails in Action">Grails in Action</a>. He is awesome, go check him out. :: <a href="https://twitter.com/pledbrook" title="Twitter for Peter">Twitter</a> ::</p>

<p>The place where it was held is <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/" title="Skills Matter">Skillsmatter</a>. Which of course is known to all, if not, go check them out as well!</p>

<p><strong>Day One</strong></p>

<p>Day one and two were about Groovy. We were faced with the quirks and hinges of the language. First tasks were Closures and Currying both of which were really interesting. A bit of functional thinking mixed into the soup.</p>

<p>The course was divided into Peter telling us about stuff for 1:30 hours and then 1:00 hour lab work which really made the whole thing interactive. We could ask questions while he was talking which I&#8217;m sure was very distracting but I hope he is used to it by now. ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>The tasks which we faced I&#8217;m sure were no real challenge for somebody who was used to thinking with closures and functions. But for us they were very intriguing.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Convert this class to it&#8217;s groovy eq.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty damn awesome.</p>

<p>For quite some time now functional languages are re-living their golden age. There are various reasons for that which I won&#8217;t list here. But it has mainly to do with scalability, concurrency and threaded programming. Also the need to eliminate boilerplate code is bigger then ever. I guess people got fed up with Java being so talkative.</p>

<p>So we moved on learning a lot about groovy and its power. We also learned some good practices from Peter what to do and what not to do. For example a line he always repeated is that he hates how a function cannot exist without a class wrapped around it. Another important thing is, which we never ever should forget, that closures are Closures. Which means they aren&#8217;t functions. They are of the type Closure.</p>

<p>And that we shouldn&#8217;t use Closures just because we can. Be sensible. If a method can achieve your task, use a method.</p>

<p><strong>Day Two</strong></p>

<p>On day 2 we got into meta-programming. That&#8217;s when the real fun started. Groovy is not only powerful and lightweight it also gives the ability to change its behaviour. Meta programming is sort of a bit new to me. So this was my first definitive intro to it. But I must say that it blew me away. The capabilities are limitless.</p>

<p>There is a class called Expando in groovy which can be used to create virtually anything on the fly what you want.</p>

<p>For example look at this code ::</p>

<p>Neat hmm? Just create expando and build up the class as you go however you want to use it.</p>

<p>And you can do this jazz to other, normal classes as well. You can add properties and methods at runtime by implementing the propertyMissing and methodMissing methods. In them afterwards you can specify some custom behaviour you would like to see. By implementing these guys you can directly control what&#8217;s happening to your class. Who is calling it how and where and why.</p>

<p>To grasp the power of metacoding and the abilities with which closures provided us with took a day to properly go over. So we moved on&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Day Three</strong></p>

<p>So groovy was over. The time has come to move on and venture into the foggy land of Grails. Turned out it wasn&#8217;t so foggy after all.</p>

<p>Grails is a rapid prototyping kind of a framework. It allows you to set up an application with a blink of an eye. And provides conventions over configuration which is a really good thing to have. But as the day was going by we realised that we would find ourself not once but many times in the bubbling boils of the underbelly of /conf.</p>

<p>Again, fortunately, it wasn&#8217;t really hard. The config was groovy and it was pretty straight forward too.</p>

<p>Our third day mostly took as off to explore scaffolding, dynamic &amp; static as well, and the interesting land of GORM Peter showed us the power of grails to create a CRUD application with in a matter of seconds / minutes ( depending on how fast your machine is ) with a fairly nice view. These types of application are usually not accepted of course as an end product&#8230; For that you need to thinker a bit here and there.</p>

<p>But things like admin portal are easily put together. So use it often and use it will and get it to know how it works.</p>

<p>In the land of GORM we explored the 4 different possibilities of data retriaval and generally how everything maps together and how GORM work with ORM.</p>

<p>The four different retrieval capabilities are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Where clauses</li>
<li>HQL (Hybernate Query Language)</li>
<li>Criteria searches</li>
<li>Dynamic finder methods</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of which we found very interesting in there own respective ways.</p>

<p>Example of a dynamic finder::</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">assert</span> Account.<span style="color: #006600;">findAllBy</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">*</span>PropertyName<span style="color: #66cc66;">**</span><span style="color: #aaaadd; font-weight: bold;">Modifier</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">*</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span>Parameters<span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span>.<span style="color: #663399;">size</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">==</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">2</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>Where propertyName is the name of the property to find by, modifier can be a sql&#8217;s Like for example.</p>

<p>So this could become something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="groovy" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">assert</span> Hitman.<span style="color: #006600;">findAllByNameLike</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"Agent %"</span><span style="color: #66cc66;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #66cc66;">==</span> <span style="color: #cc66cc;">15</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>That day was really knowledge packed. I don&#8217;t say I remember everything but luckily I wrote up some notes and I know what and where to look for if I would be in need of something.</p>

<p><strong>Day Four</strong></p>

<p>On the last day everybody was pretty much exhausted. It takes a lot to learn all that from 9 to 5 for 4 days. And Peter gave his best to staff that stuff into our heads and as much as possible of it. I think he did a pretty good job.</p>

<p>Last day was all about Controllers, Commands, Models, Views and GSPs and BootStrap config, Environment changes durring start up, the configurability of the whole framework, messages, templates, internationalisation and many thing more which can be easily put together.</p>

<p>It was pretty interesting. GSPs have similarities to JSPs but retained only the good parts. And although you can do JSP stuff in GSPs as well with nice embedded tags you have the ability to actually create a nice page which won&#8217;t be that big a maintenance nightmare.</p>

<p>Peter very much pressed the fact that the Controllers should be your only entry point from HTML requests and the views should be the only output of it. The controllers shouldn&#8217;t be throwing around business logic they should only act as proxies between the outer shell and the inner layering.</p>

<p>I think I understood most of the stuff which we were going through. Again, it was pretty straight forward. The application of it is what need practice.</p>

<p>Durring the course we created several applications. With dynamic scaffolding as well as static. We created and edited our own views and gsps. Created our own Controllers and what nots. One thing is clear. Grails let&#8217;s you progress a hell of a lot in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>And we were also talking about testing of course. Using Geb, Spock and the unit testing capabilities of Grails. All very powerful stuff. Spock has some impressive Mocking powers in junction with the good ol&#8217; Given When Then structure. If done correctly the test can be very fast and robust.</p>

<p>As final words we talked about plugins and the testing of Views and a bit more configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Closing words</strong></p>

<p>So all in all the course was excellent. Peter did a very good job of introducing use to Grails and Groovy. It&#8217;s a very good framework to build upon with a powerful language at our disposal. I&#8217;m pretty certain that Grails will evolve even more and be a great asset to people who choose to develop with it. Handle with Care though. Because no matter how awesome a tool is, it can always be used for bad purposes. ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>As always,</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and have a nice day / evening.</p>

                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>Today I&#8217;d like to share with you some of the experiences I had as a beginner tester. I hope it sets you off on a path to enlightenment and leaves you off with a good appetite for testing. Shall we begin then?</p>

<p><strong>The early days</strong></p>

<p>It was 2004 when I finished school and started working at my first company. I finished as a software developer which is kind of an exaggeration since I only finished a 2 years course of it. I wasn&#8217;t really one for school. I was more of a home learner. That&#8217;s how you learn programming these days anyways.</p>

<p>The company didn&#8217;t hire developers at that moment. At least not junior ones&#8230; But! They were kind enough to offer a position as a tester. As the saying goes, Don&#8217;t look a gift horse in the mouth, I accepted the position although my intention was to go over to development as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Years went by. I was still a tester. I foamed and fumed about it I wanted to be a dev guy. I was furious. I was angry. I was inpatient. I was an idiot. Instead of crying and instead of the light going on after 2-3 years or more I should have realised the potential of my position sooner.</p>

<p><strong>Revelation</strong></p>

<p>So there I was. I was sitting at my desk clicking away at stuff and writing up dull documentations about why I&#8217;m clicking at that stuff and how I&#8217;m clicking it. My document infect was so pretty and well formatted that I was fairly proud of it.</p>

<p>I ignored calls of my sanity and went on producing test cases and documents for many many more months / years. I was bad at my job. And I tell you why. I missed bugs I missed the little things that made the difference. I was following documentation by the letter I was leaving out things I wasn&#8217;t paying attention I wanted to be a developer damn it!</p>

<p>But fortunately because of various people in my life, like my brother, my resource manager, my friends and this guy :: James Marcus Bach ( <a href="http://www.satisfice.com/" title="http://www.satisfice.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.satisfice.com/">http://www.satisfice.com/</a></a> ) :: I soon begun to realise that this job is about so much more! I read Jame&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.buccaneerscholar.com/" title="The buccaneer scholar" target="_blank">The buccaneer scholar</a>.</p>

<p>It opened my eyes in so many ways. I knew that there is somebody else out there how is like me. Passionet and keen on learning new things. Exploring technology and going where nobody else went before. I was beginning to understand that I could be much more in this position. In my country at that time Testers weren&#8217;t regarded for too much. We were the enemy that needed defeating. We were in the way. We were somebody who had to be hated. Fortunately it changed much since then and lucky for us The Company had great support for Testers.</p>

<p>I learned that I can use my passion. I learned that testing can be / IS, indeed, the best thing that could have happened to me.</p>

<p><strong>Ascension</strong></p>

<p>With these new thoughts in my mind I begun to evolve. I realised that I can incorporate my dev skills into testing and later my testing skill into development. I was no longer following test cases blindly. I was no longer writing up pretty documentations ( I was writing other kind of documentations.. ðŸ˜‰ ). I was following instinct, skills, knowledge I hoarded from people. I was talking to the Devs, I was talking to the deployment team, I was talking to the managers AND the product owners. I hoarded knowledge as much as possible. I wrote everything down into my Mind Maps and was determined to become the single most knowledgable entity on the projects I was working on.</p>

<p>I created small tools that helped in my tedious, boring, unimaginative tasks of repetitive clicking. It didn&#8217;t took so long I was sharing my tools between other testers. Small javascripts which filled in forms. Tools, perl scripts to format docs and test results and so and so forth.</p>

<p>I embraced testing. It become my way of Life. It wasn&#8217;t a simple job anymore. It was embedded into my brain processes and synapses. And that&#8217;s when I got into automation.</p>

<p><strong>The later years</strong></p>

<p>So I got into automation. I loved it. The thought that I can bend the computers will to do my bidding / job was absolutely mind blowing. I&#8217;ve done development at that point already of course that wasn&#8217;t new to me. And I also was shown some way of automation but that wasn&#8217;t so great so I dismissed this possibility for a long time. After a while I came back to it with the thought that, hey I could do this better. Selenium came out at that time around, Watir was also there and a couple of other tools in Perl.</p>

<p>I started developing with / in / for those tools and noted that despite the believe that it&#8217;s only automation it actually took quite some thinking to come up with a framework that was adaptable, concise, manageable, fast and so on and so fort. It was an effort that most people didn&#8217;t realise or care to know about.</p>

<p>So for the better part of those years I was trying to convince people that building a testing framework requires actual development work. And is not something that should be taken lightly. I sort of succeeded with it&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Now</strong></p>

<p>After various circumstances in my life I moved to UK and took a job as an SET(Software Developer in Test). It sounds fancy but is rather just an automation guy who from time to time looks at production code. It was a spring board for me. And now days it seems I&#8217;m simply just a developer. But!!! And here comes the twist.</p>

<p>Because of my years of background in Test I feel I&#8217;m so much more. I know to write testable code. I know many ways how my code could fail. I know many ways of writing something and then coding up a script for testing or do extensive unit testing. I don&#8217;t love my code blindly so that when it&#8217;s done I only test the &#8220;happy path&#8221; because I don&#8217;t have the time to code up more.</p>

<p>I will always have time for testing. I will <strong>begin</strong> with testing. Because people need to understand that the only way to go fast is to go slow. If you go fast it will bite you in the behind and you will suffer more then you would have suffered if you would have written up that one last little test for that one last little corner for the world that is your boiling, brooding, breathing pile of code.</p>

<p><strong>The future</strong></p>

<p>Honestly I don&#8217;t know were I&#8217;m going from here. Being a full pledged developed is a new territory for me even though I was an automation dev before. But I&#8217;m looking forward to this exciting new life. And I will NEVER ditch my Testing carrier. In fact I&#8217;m aiming to complete the BBST course next month. Because once you&#8217;ve been a tester you will never go back being anything else. It becomes a part of you. And stays with you forever.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

<p>And as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>
