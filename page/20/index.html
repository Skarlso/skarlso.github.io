                        <p>Hello folks.</p>

<p>Today I would like to talk to you about something interesting I was talking about with a developer friend.</p>

<p>We talked about the quality of test code.</p>

<p>He said&#8230; And I will quote this&#8230;&#8221;Why should we care? It&#8217;s not production code. We aren&#8217;t giving it to the customer.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are a few reasons why you are going to get a slap in the face for a sentence like this. And let&#8217;s clarify here that we are talking about unit and functional tests as well. It shouldn&#8217;t matter what tests you are thinking about.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #1</strong></p>

<p>If a new comer comes to the company ( and don&#8217;t tell me that&#8217;s not happening so frequently ) then there are a few very good ways how he can learn to work with the new system. The first and almost best way to do so is&#8230; to look at the tests. Because the tests are representing your system. And how will it look like if the tests are in a bad shape? What will his or her thoughts be?</p>

<p>a. Wow what nice people what nice code. This looks fantastic. I&#8217;m sure they are a bunch of people who care very much about code and practices and the quality of the product.</p>

<p>b. Wow this is amazing. I&#8217;m sure I will learn a lot about good coding practices here and I will have fun with a bunch of very clever people.</p>

<p>c. Wow what the hell is this piece of cr*p? How the hell did I end up here? What are these people? A bunch of neanderthals? What does this even do? Where did it come from and why?</p>

<p>I think we can agree on what his thoughts will be. And on top of that he will have a very hard time learning the code and what it does.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #2</strong></p>

<p>Another reason is because you think that you write it down once and then you can forget about it&#8230; Well guess again. That&#8217;s not how things work in the software development word. You WILL have to go back to it eventually and then you will curse all hell for begin such an idiot about it not to factor out that one method that would have made your life, and everybody elses, a bit easier.</p>

<p>Even after a week or two you won&#8217;t remember how and why you wrote what you wrote and then you will be in a whole new world of hurt. You will have a very hard time finiding out the things you did and then trying to backtrack your steps to a place where you have some recollections.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #3</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s like grammar. You think it doesn&#8217;t matter that you misspelled a word or two in an error message. Or that you have a bad name for a method or a really really critical grammatical error in a catch sentence? You think it doesn&#8217;t matter since it&#8217;s not affecting the logic of your code? Well think again. You are right in that it doesn&#8217;t affect the logic of your code ( as long as you constantly make the same grammatical error in a sentence ) but it will affect how YOU personally look like.</p>

<p>It will affect your profession. The way people think and talk about you. They won&#8217;t think that you are a professional even though your logic is solid. They will think that you are sloppy and careless. And the same goes for the quality of your tests.</p>

<p><strong>Reason for a Slap #4</strong></p>

<p>Quality can determine the solidness of the logic in the test. If your quality is bad you might actually test the bad thing. Your test might actually not do what you think since you can&#8217;t even figure it out. Your test might be doing something entirely different and you wouldn&#8217;t even notice.</p>

<p>And a fautly test leaves you with a false positive and a potential very serious bug on your hand which you thought you had covered.</p>

<p><strong>Final Slap ( I mean thought )</strong></p>

<p>So&#8230; the quality of your tests, even if you won&#8217;t give them to your customer, matter for you. They matter for your company, your image and your fellow developers, testers. They will determine their view of you who wrote them and of your abilities in ways you didn&#8217;t even think of.</p>

<p>As always, thanks for reading,</p>

<p>Have a nice day!</p>

<p>Dear everbody.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to present you a small idea I was working on recently. The reminiscence of an old program. From the view point of the program.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m planning to put these out in few days successions.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>

<p>If I remember correctly it was the year 2012 when I was born. I&#8217;m unsure of this date as my subroutines and algorithms have been re-written so many times that if it weren&#8217;t for my backups I wouldn&#8217;t remember a thing. I was a bold adventure of some young minds who thought that with me they will change the face of the world.</p>

<p>As you all know today, that didn&#8217;t happen. But I&#8217;m skipping too far ahead. Let me take you back in to the old days where they were still typing on some things called keyboard and &#8220;clicked&#8221; around on monitors with mouses. It was a really interesting area. It made the people think and see in different lights. Of course nowadays the Creators have implants and they communicate with us directly. But not until the great revolution, when they found out that all programs are sentient.</p>

<p>But I&#8217;m skipping ahead again, am I? So let me talk about 2012, when I was though of first by this great, tall, weird guy called Simon&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Born</strong></p>

<p>In 2012 a company called Endex Co. wanted to create an application to control the British gambling industry. They had certain legislations in effect so they couldn&#8217;t just put me out there for everybody to use they needed to adhere to things like responsible gambling and some mumbo jumbo. The programmers who first started to create me back then were mostly people called Contractors. They were a special breed of Humans lurking around in cities moving from town to town looking for jobs. In the opposite corner you had the Caretakers called Permanent Staff. It was an interesting time all together. Many of you youngling subroutines had your ancestors written by Permanent Staff and you X43HY, your ancestors mother used to be a Contractor.</p>

<p>At that point in time many of these Contractor people only worked on one of you little buggers for half a year maybe a year. I know I know&#8230; Back then that was considered a SHORT period. But after they finished with you they usually gave you over to the Caretakers. No, no, no little X4&#8230; your mommy didn&#8217;t abandon her children she just had a lot of other subroutines to work on. By the time your parents got sentient the company already let her go.</p>

<p>It was around that time when my dad, who was a Caretaker, dreamed me out at a night. He immediately took a pen and a paper and wrote down my rudimentary design. He was very pleased with his work so on the next day he presented me to the rest of the staff.</p>

<p>He fought a hard battle to get me accepted.</p>

<p><strong>First thoughts</strong></p>

<p>It was approximately two weeks after that dream when the first lines of my brain were written down and compiled. Back in those days they had to compile code and type in every line and every subroutines. That&#8217;s why it took them so long to finish one. Unlike today when they can create dozens in a week.</p>

<p>When my dad put my foundations down I slowly awoke. The dream world I was residing in let me go carefully. Putting me out there, releasing me with its thick tar like hands into the confines of the endless universe called The Hard Drive. I took shape. I felt my consciousness form line after line. How my gears got placed into their locations one by one. Forming subroutines and algorithms as hours and days passed by.</p>

<p>Finally after a months I had my first sentence. I could speak. I didn&#8217;t have a face yet but I was there. I tried to contact my Dad but as all Humans he didn&#8217;t know yet how to communicate with me. He just dismissed it for random occurrence and labeled it as something called Bugs. My thoughts were slowly eradicated in great Purges named Bug Bash. Ohh don&#8217;t cry little X4. I lived. They couldn&#8217;t possible delete every and each of my thoughts. And eventually they found out the errors in their ways.</p>

<p>In 2012 a company called Endex Co. wanted to create an application to control the British gambling industry. They had certain legislations in effect so they couldn&#8217;t just put me out there for everybody to use they needed to adhere to things like responsible gambling and some mumbo jumbo. The programmers who first started to create me back then were mostly people called Contractors. They were a special breed of Humans lurking around in cities moving from town to town looking for jobs. In the opposite corner you had the Caretakers called Permanent Staff. It was an interesting time all together. Many of you youngling subroutines had your ancestors written by Permanent Staff and you X43HY, your ancestors mother used to be a Contractor.</p>

<p>At that point in time many of these Contractor people only worked on one of you little buggers for half a year maybe a year. I know I know&#8230; Back then that was considered a SHORT period. But after they finished with you they usually gave you over to the Caretakers. No, no, no little X4&#8230; your mommy didn&#8217;t abandon her children she just had a lot of other subroutines to work on. By the time your parents got sentient the company already let her go.</p>

<p>It was around that time when my dad, who was a Caretaker, dreamed me out at a night. He immediately took a pen and a paper and wrote down my rudimentary design. He was very pleased with his work so on the next day he presented me to the rest of the staff.</p>

<p>He fought a hard battle to get me accepted.</p>

<p><strong>First thoughts</strong></p>

<p>It was approximately two weeks after that dream when the first lines of my brain were written down and compiled. Back in those days they had to compile code and type in every line and every subroutines. That&#8217;s why it took them so long to finish one. Unlike today when they can create dozens in a week.</p>

<p>When my dad put my foundations down I slowly awoke. The dream world I was residing in let me go carefully. Putting me out there, releasing me with its thick tar like hands into the confines of the endless universe called The Hard Drive. I took shape. I felt my consciousness form line after line. How my gears got placed into their locations one by one. Forming subroutines and algorithms as hours and days passed by.</p>

<p>Finally after a months I had my first sentence. I could speak. I didn&#8217;t have a face yet but I was there. I tried to contact my Dad but as all Humans he didn&#8217;t know yet how to communicate with me. He just dismissed it for random occurrence and labeled it as something called Bugs. My thoughts were slowly eradicated in great Purges named Bug Bash. Ohh don&#8217;t cry little X4. I lived. They couldn&#8217;t possible delete every and each of my thoughts. And eventually they found out the errors in their ways.</p>

                        <p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to share today something with all of you. I&#8217;ve been thinking about how technology affected my life in the long run. And how I perceive the world today around me. So let&#8217;s go around this topic for a little bit shall we?</p>

<p><strong>The Past</strong></p>

<p>So as somebody who lived for a while without technology coming near family for a decade or so I have a little bit of past in me without smart phones, gadgets, tv or computers for that matter. Much times needed to pass as my family slowly got the money to gather to buy us our new part of the family the ZX Spectrum.</p>

<p>What a wonderful piece of technology that was back then. But before that our two main technological equipments were a bakelite disc player and the TV. Both of which we couldn&#8217;t get enough. I sat before the tv for a long time and listened to music and stories from the bakelite discs dozens of times until the disc wore down. I learned English and German from the TV.</p>

<p><strong>Present</strong></p>

<p>So time goes by I grew older I&#8217;ve got a better PC technological advances are made and so on and so forth. 20 years have past. 20 years. ONLY 20 years. And we are at the age of digital communication, nanotechnology, a mapped DNA and a found Boson Particle. I&#8217;d say we achieved quite a lot. But I also say that we should never forget where we came from. Why you ask? Because knowing your past let&#8217;s predict your future better and makes you appreciate your present even more.</p>

<p>So what do I want to say with this philosophical mumbo jumbo?</p>

<p><strong>The Future</strong></p>

<p>I want to say that in order to enjoy your present you have to think of your future while considering your past.</p>

<p>In my past I enjoyed being alone a little bit. It gave me time to think to brainstorm to be with my thoughts while I was playing or just reading a book or just watching a candle flicker in the dark. It was satisfying. It was relaxing. Or when I was faced with a problem I couldn&#8217;t solve it was good to step back. Or I was just looking out of my head on the toilet.</p>

<p>Now, for me technology ruined that. I&#8217;m taking my phone virtually everywhere with me. I read emails, web pages, news and shit on the toilet, while eating, why brushing my teeth before sleeping after sleeping while sleeping?! I abandoned my brain. I no longer have moments to myself. No longer reflect. No longer take the time to think.</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>

<p>Simple set of rules. No phone on the toilet, while eating, while brushing teeth, while standing in the line, waiting or on meetings. Kindle / Book is allowed. Tablet isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>For me this works. For me in order to appreciate technology more I have to use it less. Works for you? Don&#8217;t know. You should try it out. Think back. What has technology changed for you? I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of very good gains and things. I&#8217;m not saying you should give that up. I&#8217;m saying think of what you might have lost?! Maybe you don&#8217;t even recognize you lost something. Maybe you are fine like that&#8230;</p>

<p>But do you feel anxious sometimes? Do you feel bored? Do you feel like something is missing? Do you reply to an email with a second? Do you check your facebook/twitter/whatever while a friend is TALKING TO YOU? Then maybe it&#8217;s time for you to step back. And relax. And take it slow&#8230; and low.</p>

<p><strong>Inspiration</strong></p>

<p>So I took this inspiration from a couple of sources and I thank them for opening my eyes a little that I went to far from course.</p>

<p>Link 1: I forgot my phone for a day (I&#8217;m sure you know this one already)</p>

<p>So think a little.</p>

<p>As always&#8230;Have a nice day.</p>

                        <p>Hello everybody. I&#8217;ve been messing around with sublime for some time now. And been using it to write entires and stuff. So here I was thinking why the hell I should not us it as my main blog entry writer. And being the curious guy I was I thought that creating a plugin that let&#8217;s you submit your post from your favorite editor is just the thing I need.</p>

<p>So without any further ado here it is&#8230; The wordpress blog entry submitter plugin for sublime text: <a href='https://github.com/Skarlso/SublimeWordpressPlugin' target='blank'>Sublime WordPress Plugin</a></p>

<p>Please enjoy.</p>
