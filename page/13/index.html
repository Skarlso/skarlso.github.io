You can try something like that:
But that isn’t giving you too much now is it? And the API of scenario is as small as it can get. It offers you four options:

I attended a 4 day course of Groovy and Grails and this is my attempt at writing up a summary to see how much I retained. I’ll try to do this from the top of my head without peaking at my notes.
So let’s begin.
Introductions
First of all, introductions. The course was held by Peter Ledbrook. He is the guy who wrote Grails in Action. He is awesome, go check him out.

The early days
It was 2004 when I finished school and started working at my first company. I finished as a software developer which is kind of an exaggeration since I only finished a 2 years course of it.

Some History
I’ve been a tester for a long time now. I’ve been up and down and down and up. I struggled for a very long time until I became somebody who I am today. And I still have many things to learn ahead of me.
I learned from many people.

The beginnings…
I went to school in Oroszlany, my home town in Hungary.

Also something that I can see in the world repeating over and over again. Not just in Software business but also in History in Human nature in Physics and Systems.
So let’s see what I’m talking about.
What is Chaos?
Chaos is a state of utter confusion. Chaos is the opposite of order.

I’d like to introduce T.E.A.S. to you. This is something I came up with yesterday which requires a lot of fantasy some good thinking planning and enthusiastic people. So, let’s get started.
What is it about?
Testing Exploration Adventure Session is about… Testing! There. No real surprise, eh? TEAS has it’s roots in RPGs. Role Playing Games. If you ever heard or read about M.A.G.U.S. or the more known Dungeons &amp; Dragons you will have a better understanding of the concept behind this phenomena.

Today I want to write about a little trick I learned.
If you are working with legacy code and you don’t have the chance to eliminate core design problems, you can use this little pattern to help you out.
Problem
Problem is that you have a class that has a gazillion collaborators and at some point in time one of the clever devs thought it would be a cool idea to do dependancy injection via the constructor.

What it is about?
So what is codereatreat about? In short it’s about programmers getting together and honing and practicing there skills in order to become more at what they are doing. It’s a practice run with great people. TDDing one problem the whole day long with constantly applied constraints.
