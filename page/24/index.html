                        <p>Hi everybody.</p>

<p>Today I want to talk to you about.. Well.. How to read a professional book for slow learners without too much waste of time.</p>

<p>Let us start at the&#8230; well&#8230; the beginning. How do you normally read a book if you want to memorize it properly. You read it once and then re read the whole thing again until it gets in your head? Or do you have another strategy?</p>

<p>Let me share you mine.</p>

<p>There are a few common practices that you can apply to better your chances of retaining the information that you get out of the pages you read.</p>

<p><strong>Re-reading the right way</strong></p>

<p>Re-reading is good. You definitely can apply that but do it the right way. As you read a chapter, define small chunks of paragraphs or entities or even the whole chapter for re-reading. That means&#8230; Read an entity fully. Don&#8217;t stop at what you don&#8217;t understand don&#8217;t bother with it right now just read it. You will get a general overview of what&#8217;s going on in that segment.</p>

<p>Once done, re-read the whole entity again, but this time pay attention to the details. This time look up what you don&#8217;t understand. Go with the flow and once you&#8217;re done go to the next section. This is not all however..</p>

<p><strong>Note taking</strong></p>

<p>As you go and re-read the entity you might want to consider that it is a good time for taking notes. Note taking is really something that you have to learn. Proper note taking that is. Notes that just repeat what ever is in the book or whatever you are reading currently is bad. That is just coping, that wont help you. You have to grasp the fundamentals. You have to take out what is important and forget the rest. You have to apply SMART objectives, little annotations, small sentences WITH YOUR OWN WORDS that will lead you to better understanding of the stuff that you are reading.</p>

<p>There are several methods that you can use for note taking, my favourite is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map" title="MInd Mapping" target="_blank">Mind Mapping</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Writing up questions</strong></p>

<p>One other very good practice is simply defining your own questions. Look at the title of a chapter, maybe a small summary of the chapter if that&#8217;s available. Try to define a set of questions that you want to get out of that chapter. Try to write down at least 3-4 questions that you think will be answered in that segment.</p>

<p>Read the segment. And now try to answer your Own questions without peaking. If you can&#8217;t you either have to write down some other questions because it wasn&#8217;t answered in that chapter. Or if it was answered but you still can&#8217;t answer it from the top of your head that means that you didn&#8217;t understood that chapter and that you have to re-read that part. If you can answer it, write it down so that it will stuck with you.</p>

<p><strong>Linking information</strong></p>

<p>Your brain is mostly associative. It works the best if it can link information to old information which is already in your head. Mind mapping helps with that. Mind mapping helps identifying old information segments in your brain. Try to find some common ground with the information you have to learn now and the one you already have. Unless your brain works differently you will better remember: &#8220;Two friends went to the lake fishing at night and they caught three fishes.&#8221;; then 23.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Generally speaking re-reading is a good practice but using it alone will sometimes not get you what you want. Re-reading the whole book isn&#8217;t going to help. Writing notes helps, but use your own wording, formatting, DON&#8217;T COPY!</p>

<p>I hope that help a bit to you guys out there who don&#8217;t have a photographic memory.</p>

<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>

                        <p>Hi.</p>

<p>Today I want to talk about a common problem in many frameworks I encountered over the course of my carrier as a Java dev / automation engineer, whatnot.</p>

<p>Throwing Exceptions. That is in your method you have something like this:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">public</span> <span style="color: #000066; font-weight: bold;">void</span> insertMethodNameHere<span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #003399;">String</span> param<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span> <span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">throws</span> <span style="color: #003399;">Exception</span> <span style="color: #009900;">&#123;</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#125;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>This is bad. And I will tell you in short forms why.</p>

<p><strong>Hides exceptions</strong></p>

<p>This one should be obvious. When a method throws exception you can never be sure what kind of exceptions it handles. It will hide what problems it can encounter. It will hide possible threats and will generally mean nothing to you when it fails.</p>

<p><strong>Hides functionality</strong></p>

<p>One of the things you can do will come up with a method that throws at least six exception. Well guess what&#8230; That will tell you that the method has DESIGN ISSUES! The first rule of software development is that a method should do only one thing! Well if it throws six exceptions chances are it does more then one&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>Hard to debug</strong></p>

<p>You wont have a meaning full exception if it fails immediately. You will have to go through lines of codes and stack traces to find out what the hell happened and what threw what kind of exception where. That is just simply stupid. Why give yourself a hard time?</p>

<p><strong>So what to do instead?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Meaning full exceptions</strong></p>

<p>If you have to throw&#8230; Throw meaning full exceptions. Things like: LoginFailedExpcetion(String username, String password); In the message write:</p>

<div class="wp_syntax">
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td class="line_numbers">
        <pre>1
</pre>
      </td>
      
      <td class="code">
        <pre class="java" style="font-family:monospace;">    <span style="color: #003399;">String</span>.<span style="color: #006633;">format</span><span style="color: #009900;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #0000ff;">"Failed login with username: %s; password: %s"</span>, username, password<span style="color: #009900;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #339933;">;</span></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>When this fails you will immediately know what happened without miles of stack trace to run through.</p>

<p>When you go ahead and start to re-factor your code to handle exceptions properly you will end up with methods throwing six &#8211; seven exceptions. Don&#8217;t be afraid. That means that you finally are able to see that your code is doing many things that it is not supposed to do. Start by extracting bits and pieces of your code into smaller segments that throw a max of two exceptions. Write unit tests around the function and start running them as you re-factor. See what fails so you can track your changes as you go.</p>

<p>A general good advice is that your method should throw a maximum of <strong>TWO</strong> exception. If you have more, you are doing something more then you should. Refactor / Extract that bit into a smaller function.</p>

<p><strong>Handling exceptions</strong></p>

<p>What you really want to do is create a Layer that you will be using to capture and handle exceptions. You can than take that layer and hide it deep deep into your framework so that you never ever see it again. Just like with switch.</p>

<p>As you go you will have layers of layers of exceptions. You will have features that depend on each other and talk to each other in some ways.</p>

<p>Meaning full exception will help you find out what broke why. For example you have Login that throws a Login exception. On top of that you have an order that handles OrderFailedException. You will have an easy time seeing that the order failed because the login failed. Because you handled your login exception in the Login Layer. And you handled your OrderException in the order layer. There are no mixes. Keep it clean and keep it where it belongs.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Exceptions are part of Java just like String or int or long is. You use these wisely so why don&#8217;t you apply that same logic to your Exception handling? Don&#8217;t be afraid of having 20-25 exception classes. Group them together or leave them in their respective packages or have them in a deep layer but HAVE THEM. They WILL save time and time is always money. So they will save you money in the end when an error occurs. And errors will always occur.</p>

<p>When this fails you will immediately know what happened without miles of stack trace to run through.</p>

<p>When you go ahead and start to re-factor your code to handle exceptions properly you will end up with methods throwing six &#8211; seven exceptions. Don&#8217;t be afraid. That means that you finally are able to see that your code is doing many things that it is not supposed to do. Start by extracting bits and pieces of your code into smaller segments that throw a max of two exceptions. Write unit tests around the function and start running them as you re-factor. See what fails so you can track your changes as you go.</p>

<p>A general good advice is that your method should throw a maximum of <strong>TWO</strong> exception. If you have more, you are doing something more then you should. Refactor / Extract that bit into a smaller function.</p>

<p><strong>Handling exceptions</strong></p>

<p>What you really want to do is create a Layer that you will be using to capture and handle exceptions. You can than take that layer and hide it deep deep into your framework so that you never ever see it again. Just like with switch.</p>

<p>As you go you will have layers of layers of exceptions. You will have features that depend on each other and talk to each other in some ways.</p>

<p>Meaning full exception will help you find out what broke why. For example you have Login that throws a Login exception. On top of that you have an order that handles OrderFailedException. You will have an easy time seeing that the order failed because the login failed. Because you handled your login exception in the Login Layer. And you handled your OrderException in the order layer. There are no mixes. Keep it clean and keep it where it belongs.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Exceptions are part of Java just like String or int or long is. You use these wisely so why don&#8217;t you apply that same logic to your Exception handling? Don&#8217;t be afraid of having 20-25 exception classes. Group them together or leave them in their respective packages or have them in a deep layer but HAVE THEM. They WILL save time and time is always money. So they will save you money in the end when an error occurs. And errors will always occur.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,</p>

                        <p>Hi folks.</p>

<p>I want to write a little bit about writing a professional blog.</p>

<p><strong>Early steps</strong></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s first talk about what you understand about professional blog. It&#8217;s either a semi professional one, that mixes life with professionalism, like chess, programming, testing, painting, drawing, engineering whatever your profession is. Or it can be a purely professional one without your life getting involved in it.</p>

<p>Either way you have to decide at the beginning. Why? Because that&#8217;s the kind of people you will attract. If you want to attract people from your profession then you have to decide that you will write plenty of your profession into your blog. If you want to attract hobbists more then you write about your profession AND daily life or other situations that are essentially irrelevant. Of course you can get both in both versions but the numbers will be different.</p>

<p><strong>Commiting</strong></p>

<p>A professional blog is a commitment. Start one only when you know you can &#8220;finish&#8221; it. It is a constant commitment that you HAVE to do even if you are sick, lazy, don&#8217;t have time etc, etc.</p>

<p>I know the excuses because I made them myself a couple of times too, like: I don&#8217;t have time. I write only when I want to. I write for myself, I don&#8217;t care about people. I don&#8217;t have an idea right now. I have better things to do. I don&#8217;t feel like writing.</p>

<p>And so on and so fort&#8230; Truth is people&#8230; These are usually bull.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> You have time. Whenever you TRULY want to write you will make the 20 minutes to at least write a small post. Why? Because this is a professional blog. You WANT to get noticed. You WANT to help people. You started it because you wanted to make a difference. You wanted people to know you to praise you to acknowledge you. Guess what&#8230; If you are not writing anything, it wont happen. There are people out there with 4 children and a wife and he DOES find the time to write a blog.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> That would be true if you wouldn&#8217;t be committed to your blog. Don&#8217;t forget, this is a professional blog. This is something that you are writing to make people recognize you. Blogging is about discipline. You have to set aside some time, like 30 minutes / 1 hour to write something in your blog. Why 1 hour? Because of the research that you have to do before hand. I talk about that later. Anyways. This is a commitment. If you don&#8217;t take it seriously, then don&#8217;t write it. But then don&#8217;t wait for people getting to know you, because they wont.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> This is just plain bull. If you write for yourself make your blog private and be done with it. &#8216;nough said.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> Now this is something that we all face. In programming, in engineering in whatever your profession is, you will have a point in life, several actually, in which you don&#8217;t know what to write about. That is true. It&#8217;s common and it&#8217;s called writers block. There are several ways of over coming that you can Google it. But don&#8217;t forget this is a professional blog. Try to read a couple of others. Try to merit from real life, try to sit down and think quietly for a couple of minutes. Meditate, try to see connections where you didn&#8217;t look before. Like building a robot for helping you quit smoking. How? Easy. Smoke detector. When he detects smoke comes out and sprinkles you with water. Or, since this is a testing blog, if you ran out of ideas what you want to write about testing, try this: Read a few magazines about programming, about real life scenarios, about hostage situations, about catastrophes, about hardware failures, about how your neighbor failed to pay his rent. These ALL are great sources for identifying testing opportunities and drawing connections with the software world. What I really found to be a good practice is going around having a notebook in your pocket and the moment I&#8217;m hit with an idea I will write it into that notebook. I don&#8217;t like using a phone, or other kind of electronic device for that. Why? Because the action of taking out my book, getting my pencil and actually writing something down physically makes me remember it better. But hey&#8230; Whatever suits you best. Just do it.</p>

<p>I could go on and on to from where to merit ideas for a blog, it could even be a whole separate post but I will leave somethings to figure out for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> This correlates to directly to line 1 and line 6. If you have a writers block or you are just plain lazy or you don&#8217;t want to write at all, you will say lines like these.</p>

<p><strong>6.</strong> See <strong>5.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Writing a professional blog is about commitment and discipline. Like chess, like drawing, like your own profession it needs time, it needs nourishment it needs petting, and nurturing and loving and hating and practicing. You started this blog to reach something. You started it for yourself so you could track your progress and knowledge. You started it because writing down ideas makes you remember them better or it will make more sense to you. You started because you want to get acknowledged. You started because you want to share your experience with beginners. You started because you want all of the above.</p>

<p>Then do it. Don&#8217;t look for excuses. Writing a GOOD professional blog is hard. It will teach you much. It will make you more disciplined. It will increase your will power. It will increase your understanding of your craft. It will help other beginners who seek advice. It will help to make a name for yourself. It will help in an interview. It will generally be useful when ever you want to record a major even or idea in your life.</p>

<p>Also don&#8217;t forget&#8230; You are having fun while you are doing it. You love it, and you know you love it, because if you wouldn&#8217;t, you wouldn&#8217;t really start in the first place.</p>

<p>Oh and by the way&#8230; Not every single one of your posts must be a small book sized one. You ARE allowed to write smaller pieces in a hurry if you just wanted to share a general idea.</p>

<p>Hope you liked this and I hope it could help you get started or to keep you on track.</p>

<p>Have a nice day,</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>

                        <p>Hi!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve seen this many times over and over again. Many people have wrote books about it already. Like Uncle Bob&#8217;s Clean Code. Like Pragmatic Programmer by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas. What makes your code understandable to others.</p>

<p>Is it <strong>Comments</strong>?</p>

<p>No. It&#8217;s not comments. If your code could be read properly you wouldn&#8217;t need comments to explain what it does. Like Uncle Bob said. A good code doesn&#8217;t contain surprises. It does exactly what you would think it should do on the next line. It doesn&#8217;t have curves and misinformation. It doesn&#8217;t have plots and turns of events like a good crime book. No. Good code is a like a boring soap opera with predictable plot and boring plain characters who don&#8217;t change there behavior based on circumstances.</p>

<p>Good code is easy to read. It flows like the river, falls like a waterfall, cooks like bacon and crosses the road like a professional chicken. If I read line A the next line should be B. If it is a Z or a :@L$&#8230; I wont be happy.</p>

<p>So then what makes it understandable?</p>

<p>On simple word: <strong>Readability</strong>.</p>

<p>What makes it readable?</p>

<p>Small chunks of functions that have descriptive names as few parameters as possible and do only ONE thing at a time. Of course this is not all there is&#8230; However it&#8217;s the best thing to begin with. A function called &#8220;doStuff&#8221; that has a complexity of 300 has three fors, two switches and a dozen ifs isn&#8217;t really helping. Now if you look at doStuff and try to give a name based on the job of the function and come up with &#8220;propageXWithFiveUnlessYEqualsTheSumOfZPlusW&#8221; you will know it does more then one thing.</p>

<p>If you see a really complex function in your production code or hobby code ask yourself: &#8220;Should this really be like 300 lines long and with a complexity of 200??&#8221; And as you speak this out loud you will know the answer already. Break it up. Have like a dozen smaller functions that will be better I promise you. Take out parts. Write unit tests to it that help with re-factoring. Break it down into as small chunks as possible. It will be worth it. It will increase understand-ability, readability and maintainability.</p>

<p>Hope that helped.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice Day,</p>

<p>Gergely.</p>

It will be worth it. It will increase understand-ability, readability and maintainability.</p>

<p>Hope that helped.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and as always,</p>

<p>Have a nice Day,</p>
