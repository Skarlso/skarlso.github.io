                    Hello everybody!
I wanted to do a sort post about word frequency count. I did it many times now and I was curious as how a recursive solution would perform as opposed to looping.
So I wrote it up quickly and added a few benchmarks with different sized data.
First&hellip;. The code:
var freqMap = make(map[string]int, 0) func countLettersRecursive(s string) string { if len(s) == 0 { return s } freqMap[string(s[0])]++ return countLettersRecursive(s[1:]) } func countLettersLoop(s string) { for _, v := range s { freqMap[string(v)]++ } } Very simple.

Here is a little something I&rsquo;ve put together, since I&rsquo;m doing it a lot.
Go Development Environment
If I have a project I&rsquo;d like to contribute, like GoHugo, I have to setup a development environment, because most of the times, I&rsquo;m on a Mac. And on OSX things work differently. I like to work in a Linux environment since that&rsquo;s what most of the projects are built on.

                    Hello Folks Welcome to my new blog. I decided to move away for a number of reasons, but setting up a static page blog site is very cool if you don&rsquo;t directly use a database. Since posts are just posts and I have a different way of hosting images, this really was just a matter of time.
And Hugo / Github pages provided the tools which made this move possible.

                    Hi folks.
So, I was playing around and created a client for JIRA written in Go. It was nice to do some JSON transformation. And sending POSTS was really trivial.
It’s still in it’s infancy and I have a couple of more features I want to implement, but, here is the code…
It can also be found under my github page: GoJira Github.
Feel free to open up issues if you would like to use it and need some features which you would find interesting.

Today, I present to you the One Hundred Day Github Challenge.
The rules are simple:
 Minimum of One commit every day for a Hundred days. Commit has to be meaningful but can be as little as a fix in a Readme.md. Doesn’t matter if you are on vacation, there are no exceptions. There. Are. No. Exceptions. If you fail a day, you have to start over. No cheating.

If you have the tendency, like me, to forget that you are on the corporate VPN, or leave a certain software open when you bring your laptop to work, this might be helpful to you too.
It’s a small script which kills a program when you change your Wifi network.
Script:
Now, the trick is, on OSX to only trigger this when your network changes. For this, you can have a ‘launchd’ daemon, which is configured to watch three files which relate to a network being changed.

Ever used Job DSL pluginfor Jenkins? What is that you say? Well, it’s TEH most awesome plug-in for Jenkins to have, because you can CODE your job configuration and put it under source control.
Today, however, I’m not going to write about that because the tutorials on Jenkins JOB DSL are very extensive and very well done. Anyone can pick them up.
Today, I would like to write about a part of it which is even more interesting.
