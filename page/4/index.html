In this part, I&rsquo;m going to talk about the experimental plugin system of Furnace.
Go Experimental Plugins Since Go 1.8 was released, an exciting and new feature was introduced called a Plug-in system. This system works with dynamic libraries built with a special switch to go build. These libraries, .so or .dylib (later), are than loaded and once that succeeds, specific functions can be called from them (symbol resolution).

AWS SDK Fortunately, the Go SDK for AWS is quiet verbose and littered with examples of all sorts. But that doesn&rsquo;t make it less complex and less cryptic at times. I&rsquo;m here to lift some of the early confusions, in hopes that I can help someone to avoid wasting time.

Just a quick headsup, that older posts and images, may have been lost unfortunately, because I made the terrible mistake, when I migrated over from my old blog, that I forgot to download all the images from the remote host.
For lack of options, I deleted the images. :/ Sorry for the inconvencience!

Today, I would like to write about how to do HTTPS for a website, without the need to buy a certificate and set it up via your DNS provider. Let&rsquo;s begin.
Abstract What you will achieve by the end of this post:
 Every call to HTTP will be redirected to HTTPS via haproxy. HTTPS will be served with Haproxy and LetsEncrypt as the Certificate provider. Automatically update the certificate before its expiration.

Forewords The Project Everything I did in the first post, and that I&rsquo;m going to do in this example, can be found in this project: Google-OAuth-Go-Sample.
Just to recap, we left off previously on the point where we successfully obtained information about the user, with a secure token and a session initiated with them.

                    Intro Hey folks.
So, there is this project called Huginn which I absolutely love.
But the thing is, that for a couple of scrappers ( at least for me ), I don&rsquo;t want to spin up a whole rails app.
Hence, I&rsquo;ve come up with RScrap. Which is a bunch of Ruby scripts run as cron jobs on a raspberry pi. And because I dislike emails as well, and most of the time, I don&rsquo;t read them, I opted for a nicer solution.
