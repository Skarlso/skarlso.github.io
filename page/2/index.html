  Afferent couplings (Ca): The number of classes in other packages that depend upon classes within the package is an indicator of the package&rsquo;s responsibility.

Today I thought I show you how you can use Github Actions to deploy a hugo based blog like this one.
Let&rsquo;s dive in.
Actions What are actions? If you read the above linked document they are basically steps performed in containers based on some events that happened with your repository. Events can be such as pushing, creating a PR or creating/closing an issue etc.
We need an even on a push.

I&rsquo;ve been using the Hugo build for wercker for a long time now. Recent problems occurred though where I did not understand at first what the problem was. It was quite difficult to debug since I did not have too much insight on the wercker build itself. Turned out that I deleted the GITHUB token that the process was using. However, the error message was telling me that a function failed to load some other function.

Following a long search and reading lots of debates and possibilities of doing SSH within Go, I was shocked to see that not a great many tools and people use SSH with host key verification. What I usually see is this:
HostKeyCallback: ssh.InsecureIgnoreHostKey() This is terrible. Now, I realise that doing HostKeyVerification can be tedious, but don&rsquo;t fear. It&rsquo;s actually easy now that the Go team provided the knownhosts subpackage in their crypto SSH package located here: KnownHosts.

Back in the old days when Go didn&rsquo;t have the plugin package, HashiCorp was desperately looking for a way to use plugins.
In the old days, Lua plus Go wasn&rsquo;t really a thing yet, and to be honest, nobody wants to write Lua ( joking!).
And thus Mitchell had this brilliant idea of using RPC over the local network to serve a local interface as something that could easily be implemented with any other language that supported RPC.

A quick update, but a very important and interesting one hopefully. Furnace just got a massive boost to its plugin system.
I&rsquo;m using HashiCorp&rsquo;s Go-Plugins system now to handle plugins. This means one of two things that are interesting to the plugin author.
One, plugins can be written in any language which is supported by Furnace and supports GRPC. Currently this means that plugins can be written in the following languages:

Today, I would like to write about a little tool I put together in Rust.
It&rsquo;s called gotp. I&rsquo;m calling it gotp mainly because of crates.io. I published it there as well, you can find it under this link: crates.io/gotp.
The purpose is clear. It&rsquo;s a totp generator I wrote a while ago in C++ but now it&rsquo;s in rust. It can generate a token and save it into an account file that is AES encrypted.
